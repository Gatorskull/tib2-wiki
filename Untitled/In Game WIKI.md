[[[How To Play]]]
Getting started in The Infinite Black 2 is easy!

You are the captain of a small spaceship exploring the universe, killing pirates, gathering resources and looting treasure!

The universe is represented by a map of connected squares, called sectors.

Think of a sector like a room: Inside you will find enemies to kill, asteroids to harvest and other players. Travel from sector to sector by clicking on the squares to plot a course!

Your first <u><link=”Missions”>Mission</link></u> is to explore the Sol Star System while fighting pirates and harvesting asteroids. You will receive free <u><link=”Ships”>ships</link></u> as you level up and explore the universe. Once you earn another ship, click “Deploy 2nd Ship” to grow your fleet!

The universe is huge with over 30,000 sectors to explore! Enemies become more difficult in higher <u><link="The Starmap">Security Rating maps</link></u> where players fight for territory with their corporation.

Joining a <u><link=”Corporations”>Corporation</link></u> early is very important! They provide you with <u><link="Technology">technology</link></u> benefits, advice, hunting groups and access to advanced <u><link=”Ship Crafting”>ship construction</link></u>. If your corporation isn't helpful you should find one that is (they benefit from you joining too).

<u><link="Technology">Technology</link></u>, <u><link="Skills">Skills</link></u> and <u><link="Item Types">Items</link></u> all stack together to provide your ships with a +XP% Bonus. When you kill an enemy NPC you gain XP based on your ship's level versus the target's level. A percentage of that XP gained is then given to your player, and a percentage of that is given to your corporation. This means that you can increase player and corp XP by boosting your ship XP.

? - <mark>What is Ship Durability?</mark>
When ships are destroyed they can potentially lose a small amount of durability. This durability reduces certain <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> like Resource Capacity, Hull, Shields and Resists. Ship Durability can be repaired with <u><link=”Skulls”>Skulls</link></u> using the REPAIR button on the ship inspection panel.

[[[Corporations]]]
Corporations are the social backbone of The Infinite Black 2. Most game features involve working as a team to unlock <u><link="Technology">technology</link></u>, capture <u><link=”Artifacts”>artifacts</link></u>, harvest <u><link=”Relics”>relics</link></u> and fight in the <u><link=”Alliances”>Alliance War</link></u>.

There is no downside to joining a corporation and many benefits! New players should find a friendly and active corp as soon as possible! They can provide hunting groups, access to better ships, protection from <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">PvP</link></u> and more!

Corporations earn XP from every kill, then level up and train <u><link="Skills">skills</link></u> just like players. A corporation's skill and technology choices apply to all <u><link=”Ships”>ships</link></u> owned by its members.

Every corporation begins with a planet, garrison, outpost and shipyard <u><link=”Corporation Defense Structures”>defense unit</link></u>. These are leveled-up using resource deposits, which unlock more <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Points</link></u> and gear slots. Defense units may be deployed in PvP <u><link="The Starmap">system maps</link></u> to grow corporation and <u><link=”Alliances”>alliance</link></u> territory. Corporation members can invest <u><link="Tech Points">Tech Points</link></u> to unlock more defense units from the Corporation Management panel.

Ships owned by members of a Corporation might be summoned as <u><link=”Corporate Defender Ships”>Corporate Defenders</link></u> to protect defense units under attack. These ships will deploy automatically and fight under the control of the game's AI.

Gems may spawn anywhere in the game at any Security Rating, although typically in more difficult areas.

Clues about where to find gems are whispered secretly to one player every 30 minutes! Sometimes a whole <u><link=”Corporations”>corporation</link></u> might also be told, or possibly the entire universe! Gems will not be visible for 30 minutes (even to the person who got the clue). This gives captains a chance to capture their prize before someone else.

There are over 50 Solar Systems to explore with unique secrets, treasures and enemies! To view the Starmap click on the "hamburger menu" drop-down near your player button, then click Starmap.

Each solar system is controlled by one of five Factions: Humans, Hets, Pirates, Precursors, and Wyrd. Every faction has a powerful <u><link=”Corporation Defense Structures”>homeworld</link></u> that can be raided later by advanced corporations for high-value rewards.

[[[The Wyrd Alien Faction]]]
Individuals of the Wyrd species bear a resemblance to Earth's spiders, having eight limbs. Six of these function as legs, while the remaining two have hands with multiple fingers, enabling them to perform intricate tasks with greater precision than humans. Little information is available about their social structure, with most knowledge coming from observations of injured specimens.

Captured Wyrd specimens are comparable in size and weight to Earth's horses. They have a facial structure featuring eight eyes and large, venomous mandibles. These mandibles are specially adapted for grinding their prey. Interestingly, Wyrd can mimic human speech, but their native communication seems to involve complex clicks and screeches. Scientists suggest a possible telepathic component in their language, as efforts to understand it have been unsuccessful.

The venom of the Wyrd acts as a potent neurotoxin, paralyzing their prey while keeping it alive for subsequent feeding or storage. There is a theory that the Wyrd may use their captured prey as live hosts for their eggs.

All Wyrd specimens observed so far have been male, leading experts to speculate that the captured ones might belong to a worker or warrior class within their society. It is suspected that other members of their species could be more dangerous, potentially exhibiting variations in size, strength, and intelligence. As of now, there is no insight into the individual personalities of the Wyrd.

[[[The Het Alien Faction]]]
The Hets are a mysterious species known for living in open space and moving in large herds, or pods similar to Earth's cetaceans, with an average pod size of about fifty. Individual encounters with Hets are extremely rare. Their social structure is almost nonexistent, seemingly operating on a hive-mind that enables a single unit to act without any regard for individuality, focusing solely on the pod's well-being.

Once docile, Hets used to only become aggressive when threatened, preferring to flee but resorting to an organized swarm attack if necessary. They posed a navigation hazard, attacking ships only if their young were endangered, however the introduction of a techno-organic virus by The Wyrd transformed Hets into an aggressive species.

The Wyrd, in an attempt to weaponize the Hets against humans, introduced the virus, causing the Hets to develop organo-metallic armor and bio-organic weapons. Contrary to the Wyrd's expectations, the Hets resisted control, posing a significant threat to both the Wyrd and humans. In a twist, human technology has adapted to harvest and integrate Het organs into their ships, exploiting their transformed biology.

Physically, Hets resemble organic long ships with flukes and tails, believed to travel using solar wind currents. They show no signs of distinct personalities, likely due to their hive-mind dominance.

[[[The Pirate Faction]]]
Originally from Earth in the Sol system, many humans were forced to flee their planet due to severe over-pollution and resource exploitation. Corporations saved their loyalists but abandoned the rest, leading to the death of billions! Pirate Fleets soon followed, composed of survivors in ragtag improvised ships.

The Earth Defense Force is a fascist and nationalistic human faction that remains on the planet, jealously guarding what little remains. Their only export to the galaxy is an endless flood of desperate colonists, the elderly and prisoners. They will typically provide earthlings with a small ship, but at the cost of permanent indentured servitude.

Humans transplanted to other planets and space stations adapted to their varied environments, leading to noticeable physical and genetic adaptations in the colonial populations. All humans are carbon-based, breathe oxygen, and have a nine-month gestation period. Physical characteristics such as hair color, height, and weight vary widely.

Corporations have augmented their military forces with vat-grown clones, engineered for war without the ability to feel pain or fear. These clones vary physically but are created solely for combat. It is estimated that over 70% of all living humans in the universe are warrior clones, fighting wars against both aliens and each other.

Human personalities are diverse, influenced by different cultures and backgrounds. Corporate humans are driven by greed, a trait that led to Earth's downfall and continues to dominate their values in space. Corporate espionage and deceit are commonplace, and interactions with them require caution.

Pirate humans, while similar in their pursuit of wealth, differ in their abandonment of social bonds and are often guided by laws or a code of honor. These codes vary among clans but are essential for successful negotiation and trade. In contrast, corporate humans lack such a code of honor, with all profits directed to their leadership.

The human race has engaged in open war with every known alien species for hundreds of years. Most humans believe the only alternative is extinction and this fight for survival to be all which matters.

[[[The Precursor Alien Faction]]]
The Precursors, a profoundly ancient and mysterious alien race, have existed in the universe for billions of years. Known for their ostensibly robotic forms, it remains unclear whether these are their actual bodies or simply avatars. This ambiguity is heightened by their advanced technology, notably their self-destruct mechanisms, which prevent any form of capture and study, thus maintaining their enigmatic status.

While they are engaged in an obscure conflict with a formidable entity known as The Oblivion, the exact nature of this struggle and its implications for the broader universe are not well understood. The Precursors communicate with other species, including humans, in a manner that is urgent and often cryptic, suggesting they perceive themselves as guardians against greater cosmic threats. The true extent and motivation behind their protective stance are as much a mystery as their origins and physical nature.

Despite their technological prowess and long-standing presence, much about The Precursors remains unknown, including their societal structures, cultural aspects, and ultimate intentions. Their interactions with other species are marked by a combination of warning and oblique guidance, adding to their complex and intriguing characterization in the cosmic tableau.

[[[Artifacts]]]
There are over 50 mysterious alien artifacts scattered throughout the universe.

<u><link=”Corporations”>Corporations</link></u> can capture and store these at their <u><link=”Corporation Defense Structures”>planets and garrisons</link></u>, reaping the <u><link="Technology">technology</link></u> benefits. Controlling an artifact grants its tech bonus to all members of that corporation, regardless of <u><link="Skills">Skill Tree</link></u> investment or unlocked tech research.

Any player can STUDY an artifact which permanently awards +1 <u><link="Skills">Skill Point</link></u>. This is a long-term goal for players who will seek out artifacts to study over the course of the game, and collect every bonus skill point.

If a corporation has captured an artifact only their alliance members can study it! This is a perk for joining their corporation and also an incentive for outsiders to attack and liberate artifacts. The corporate tech bonus is lost if control of the artifact is lost, but the player skill point bonuses are forever once studied.
[[[Corporation Defense Structures]]]
Any <u><link=”Corporations”>corporation</link></u> that wants to survive The Infinite Black must upgrade and maintain its defense units! These structures are critical for success -- They build new ships, protect <u><link="Artifacts">artifacts</link></u> and spread a sphere of influence that hurts intruders while helping members.

Captains earn bonus <u><link=”Skulls”>Skulls</link></u> as a reward for both DEFENDING and ATTACKING corporate structures (non-NPC only). Participation in Player vs Player defense combat is one of the best ways to earn Skulls!

Defense Units are designed to represent 10 to 15 ships-worth of firepower! Most of their stats are multiplied by 10x in attack calculations, so equipping one good item on a defense unit is like equipping one good item on 15 defender ships!

Weapons and fighter drones equipped to defense units can attack faster than their advertised speed. This is a scaling bonus: Slower weapons attack much faster, while fast weapons receive little bonus. It is highly advantageous to equip your defense units with very slow weapons!

<b>Defense units must have a 3,000+ <u><link="Item Types">Gear Score</link></u> or be recalled!</b>

<b>PLANETS</b> are the central hub of every good corporation. Members can choose to respawn at the Corporate Planet instead of Earth (Settings -> Gameplay Menu). Planets grant a system-wide <u><link="Technology">technology</link></u> bonus to all members, and multiply +Max Hull and +Max Shield <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> by 40x. Each corporation has one planet. Planets deployed on a Sacred Relic Shrine grant their technology bonus to the entire alliance, throughout the entire game.

<b>GARRISONS</b> provide corporations with a powerful Garrison Strike area attack, similar to Nova explosions. Damage from a strike is derived from the Garrison's level and Max <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Points</link></u>. Garrisons multiply +Max Hull and +Max Shield stats by 30x. Each corporation can have up to 4 Garrisons. <u><link=”Relics”>Relic Shrines</link></u> can only be captured by a Garrison.

<b>OUTPOSTS</b> grow a sphere of territory influence 1 sector every 6 hours, up to a max of (2 + Outpost_Level/5). Corp members in the territory receive a movement and resist bonus, while enemies are slower and less protected. Outposts multiply +Max Hull and +Max Shield stats by 12x. Each corporation can have up to 8 Outposts.

<b>SHIPYARDS</b> <u><link="Ship Crafting">construct</link></u> new <u><link="Ships">Ships</link></u> for use by corporation members, unlocking new blueprints as they level up. Shipyards multiply +Max Hull and +Max Shield stats by 12x. Each corporation can have up to 3 Shipyards.

Defense Protection Shields play an important role in <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">Alliance PvP</link></u>. When any defense unit is attacked, it gains a 90-second immunity shield so defenders have time to organize. All ships in the sector are immune to PvP during this period (including attackers). A 1-hour protection shield will also be raised once enough attackers die, giving defenders a break from non-stop combat. Alliance leaders can type :ALLIANCE SHIELD in chat to raise a 4-hour shield once per day.

- All defense units multiply +Splash Chance stat by 10x
- All defense units multiply Battery Capacity stat by 10x
- All defense units multiply Battery Recharge stat by 4x
- There is no 10% <u><link="Item Types">auxiliary item</link></u> stat penalty like ships receive.
- Weapons and Fighter Drones attack 6x faster than normal.
- Defenses ignore <u><link=”Ship & Defense Unit Size”>targeting speeds</link></u>, targeting nearly instantly.
- Defenses are leveled up with resources from their inspect menu.
- You can Quick Jump to any structure under attack except Outposts.
- Engage an enemy defense unit to prevent quick-jumps to it.
- NPC Defenses drop high-quality items and rare crafting components
- All defenses drop hundreds or thousands of resources.
- Players earn <u><link=”Skulls”>Skulls</link></u> for killing non-NPC defense units.
- <u><link="Corporations">Corporations</link></u> can deploy Garrisons on top of Shrines to harvest <u><link=”Relics”>Relics</link></u> for their <u><link=”Alliances”>Alliance</link></u>.
- Defenses can deploy in human-controlled PvE maps but recall after 15 days.
[[[Ship & Defense Unit Size]]]
Every combat entity has a size classification: Small, Medium, Large, Huge or Massive. Size modifies a variety of factors such as movement speed, evasion, and weapon targeting speed.

See the <u><link="Ships">Ships Wiki</link></u> for fleet size and captain level requirements.

Big ships are designed to fight other bigs, so they naturally have trouble targeting little shuttles and frigates. Before weapons can be fired at an enemy, a target lock must first be acquired. The greater the disparity in size, the longer the large attacker's targeting speed. This rewards players for fielding small ships in their fleet -- Although they can't carry as much equipment, they are much more evasive. Fleets will want their smaller ships to target other small ships, and leave the big guns for the big guys.

Ship size also controls movement speed: There is a pre-move "warm up" time which players see as a pre-jump animation. This is 0.7 seconds for Small ships, 1 second for Medium, 1.3 seconds for Large and 1.7 for Huge or Massive ships. The Skip Drive Engine and <u><link=”Gravity Drives”>Gravity Drives</link></u> reduces this to 0.5 seconds for any ship.

<u><link=”Corporation Defense Structures”>Defense Units</link></u> like Planets and Garrisons do not have a targeting limit and can attack anything immediately. Very slow weapons attached to defense units receive an attack speed bonus, however.

<u><link="Item Types">Fighter Drones</link></u> ignore size disparity, making Carriers highly effective against small targets as they carry a large complement of drones.

<u><link="Hardcore Ships & Defense Units">Hardcore ships</link></u> generate <u><link="Pity Loot Drops">pity loot</link></u> at 2x the Oblivion accelerated rate if they get the killing shot. This stacks with all other loot bonuses, providing up to a 10x bonus (or even more during invasions).

<u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u> rules on the Oblivion Server:
* Hardcore ships drop one item on death (not everything)
* Normal ships do not drop any equipment on death
* Equipped items are damaged by 1% durability on death
* Ships lose 1% Ship Durability on death

WARNING: Staff will NEVER refund or repair items or ships on the Oblivion Server for any reason -- Even if your death was our fault, caused by lag or bugs. You agree to these terms by playing on the Oblivion Server.
[[[Hardcore Ships & Defense Units]]]
Any ship or defense unit can opt-in as Hardcore to gain -10% Movement Cooldown, +25 <u><link="Skills">Skill Points</link></u> and +3 <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Points</link></u> (or +10 for corporate defense units). Hardcore units can also invest an additional 5 <u><link="Skills">Skill Points</link></u>.

When any hardcore unit dies it drops 1 random <u><link="Item Types">equipment item</link></u>. They cannot equip free newbie gear, and lose slightly more durability on death.
[[[Corporate Defender Ships]]]
<u><link="Ships">Ships</link></u> owned by members of a <u><link=”Corporations”>corporation</link></u> might be summoned while the player is offline to help protect <u><link=”Corporation Defense Structures”>defense units</link></u> under attack. These are automatically deployed and controlled by the game's AI but will recall if the player logs in.

Corp Defenders killed during an attack do not lose any durability or suffer penalties. To be eligible a ship must be Level 10 or higher, have a weapon equipped and a <u><link="Item Types">Gear Score</link></u> of 1,000 or higher. <u><link="Hardcore Ships & Defense Units">Hardcore ships</link></u> will never be used as Corp Defenders.

Corporate <u><link=”Alliances”>Alliances</link></u> share their pool of Corp Defenders so that any ship in the alliance can be called to fight at any defense unit. The strongest available defenders deploy first, with a mix of small and large units.
[[[Stat Bonus Diminishing Returns]]]
"Diminishing Returns" is a term which means receiving less benefit the more you have of something.

This concept is applied to <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> in TIB2, so that stacking more and more of a particular stat gains less and less benefit from it. This protects mechanics from breaking, such as someone finding so much +Evasion gear that they are totally invulnerable. It also encourages players to use other stats and <u><link="Item Types">items</link></u> they might otherwise not, because they receive less benefit from maximizing the "best" stats.

Another benefit is that this allows new players to catch up more quickly and become competitive with less expensive gear.

Example: Outgoing Damage stat increases how much total damage your attacks do. In TIB2, once you have more than +5% Outgoing Damage, any additional gear which increases Outgoing Damage will be slightly less effective. So if all of your items give +6% Outgoing Damage bonus, your <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> will actually have +5.8% Outgoing Damage bonus instead of 6%. This will be reflected in the ship's displayed stats.

[[[Item Types]]]
There are 9 types of Equipment Items in The Infinite Black:
- Weapon
- Armor
- Shield
- Battery
- Storage
- Drone (Fighter, Medic and Harvester)
- Engine
- Computer
- Special

Weapons, Armor, Shields and Storage have a Rank which modifies their power and <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Point Cost</link></u>. These and other <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> can be changed by clicking the UPGRADE button when inspecting an item.

All items drop as loot, are <u><link="Item Crafting">crafted</link></u>, or can be won as a prize in <u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u>. There are also many different classes of Consumable items, such as Quality Repair Kits, Nanobot Boosts and <u><link="Ship Mods">Ship Mods</link></u>.

Many mechanics in the game test your ship's GEAR SCORE, such as joining The Arena or earning <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">PvP</link></u> rewards. Gear Score is a point value assigned to each item depending on factors such as Rarity, Quality and Rank. Your <u><link="Ships">ship's</link></u> Gear Score is the sum of all equipped item scores.

<b>DRONES</b>
There are three drone types: Fighter, Harvester and Repair. Fighter drones are basically weapons that don't consume battery power. Harvester drones allow you to gather resources from asteroids and debris. Repair drones provide passive healing over time. Most players will want at least one Harvester drone except when joining fleet <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">PvP</link></u>. Fighter Drones ignore <u><link=”Ship & Defense Unit Size”>size disparity</link></u>, making them highly effective against small targets.

Check out <u><link="Player Guides">Item Guides</link></u> written by other players for their thoughts and opinions on equipment.

[[[Void Items]]]
Void items are a rare and powerful variant of regular equipment. Each Void item has an extra stat bonus similar to <u><link="Mutate Item Kit">mutated items</link></u>, but grows more powerful as you upgrade the item's rarity. Additionally, Void gear gains more <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> from item quality rating, making them significantly better than equivalent non-Void items.

There are several ways to discover Void Items:
- <u><link="Item Crafting">Crafters</link></u> use :CRAFTVOID in chat
- <u><link="Item Crafting">Crafted items</link></u> have a 1:50 chance to be Void
- <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">NPC defense units</link></u> can drop Void loot
- <u><link="Free Daily Gifts">Free Weekly Gift</link></u> rewards for <u><link="Party Boxes">Party Box</link></u> missions
- <u><link=”Skulls”>Standard Arena</link></u> prizes have a 1:20 chance to be Void
- Hardcore Arena prizes have a 1:4 chance to be Void
- Invasion victory loot has a 1:20 chance to be Void
- Normal loot drops have a 1:5000 chance to be Void

Void items can be <u><link="Mutate Item Kit">mutated</link></u> and upgraded like normal gear, however it costs <u><link="Relics">Relics</link></u> to upgrade them to the highest rarity. The required Relic's faction matches the item's faction, with 1 for Elite, 2 for Mythic and 3 for Omega.

Re-Void Kits can be acquired with <u><link="Reward Point Gifts">Reward Point Gifts</link></u> which allow the Void bonus to be randomly re-rolled. Normal non-Void items can be converted to Void with the crafted Void Upgrade Kit (Captain Panel -> Item Crafting).

Void items have a different name for rarity ranks:
Basic = Basic Void
Uncommon = Primal Void
Rare = Rare Void
Ultra-Rare = Exotic Void
Elite = Elite Void
Legendary = Mythic Void
Ultimate = Omega Void
[[[Elite Ranks]]]
<u><link="Ships">Ships</link></u> and <u><link=”Corporation Defense Structures”>Defense Units</link></u> can permanently improve their default <u><link="Technology">Technology</link></u>, <u><link="Skills">Skill Points</link></u> and <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Points</link></u> by upgrading Elite Ranks. This is done on the Unit Inspect Panel with the ELITE RANK button, using <u><link=”Skulls”>Skulls</link></u> earned from <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">Player-vs-Player</link></u> kills.

You can preview what technology improvements are possible by pressing the ELITE RANK button without approving the upgrade.

<b>SHIP ELITE RANK COST</b>
Rank 1 is 100 Skulls
Rank 2 is 500 Skulls
Rank 3 is 1,000 Skulls
Rank 4 is 2,000 Skulls
Rank 5 is 3,000 Skulls

<i>Defense unit upgrade costs are 5x ship upgrade costs.</i>

<b>STRIKER GUNBOAT</b>
The starting Striker Gunboat can eventually become your most powerful ship! Each Elite Rank upgrade adds +3 Equip Points, powerful technology and additional equipment slots:
Elite Rank 1 adds +1 Battery Slot
Elite Rank 2 adds +1 Battery Slot
Elite Rank 3 adds +1 Battery Slot, +1 Weapon Slot
Elite Rank 4 adds +1 Drone Slot, +1 Weapon Slot, Reverse Hacking Tech
Elite Rank 5 adds +1 Drone Slot, Reverse Grapple Tech

[[[Skulls]]]
Skulls are a currency and crafting resource awarded to Captains exclusively for <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">Player-vs-Player</link></u> kills, with many uses throughout the game. For example, <u><link="Ship Crafting">ship crafting</link></u> requires Skulls and <u><link=”Relics”>Relics</link></u> to construct advanced blueprints, Skulls are needed to repair damaged Ship Durability and upgrade <u><link="Elite Ranks">Elite Ranks</link></u>.

Bonus Skulls are awarded for DEFENDING or ATTACKING non-NPC <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Defense Units</link></u>. Join a <u><link=”Corporations”>Corporation</link></u> and ask them about getting involved in the <u><link="Alliances">Alliance Wars</link></u>!

<b>THE ARENA</b>
The best place to earn Skulls is in The Arena, which is a controlled player-vs-player environment with balanced teams and no external influences like <u><link="Artifacts">Artifacts</link></u> or <u><link="Skills">Corporation Skills</link></u>. Arena rounds launch regularly every few hours and are open to any captain. The minimum requirement for new players is a <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> with a <u><link="Item Types">Gear Score</link></u> of 1,000 and no free starting gear. Advanced players are required to bring more than 1 ship depending on the type of arena.

The Arena is won by the team with the most kills! Captains who lost but had high kill counts will also receive bonus rewards. There is no ship durability loss on death in The Arena and gear only loses 1% half of the time.

You can access The Arena through your Captain Panel using the ARENA button once registration is announced. The Arena begins every few hours at the top of the hour.
[[[Skills]]]
Player Captains, <u><link="Ships">Ships</link></u>, <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Defense Units</link></u> and <u><link=”Corporations”>Corporations</link></u> each have a Skill Tree where points can be invested for permanent stat improvements. All of these skill tiers stack: Your final stat bonus is a combination of your captain, corporation and ship's skills!

New skill points are awarded with each level, plus your Captain gains bonus points every time they study an <u><link="Artifacts">Artifact</link></u>.

Skills can be invested up to 10 points per stat, however the bonus is reduced above 5 points, so you might consider other <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> before maxing one out. <u><link="Hardcore Ships & Defense Units">Hardcore Ships and Defense Units</link></u> gain bonus skill points and can invest an additional 5 max per stat.

Like stats gained from <u><link="Item Types">Items</link></u> and <u><link="Technology">technology</link></u>, stats from Skills are also subject to <u><link="Stat Bonus Diminishing Returns">Diminishing Returns</link></u>.
[[[Item Crafting]]]
Players can find their item crafting blueprints and resources by navigating to the Captain Panel, then clicking the ITEM CRAFTING button. To craft an <u><link="Item Types">item</link></u>, simply collect enough resources required by its blueprint then click the blueprint button. You will discover new blueprints when you "Research" an item instead of scrapping it.

It is recommended that new players do not start crafting until later. Crafting is expensive and often supported by a <u><link="Corporations">Corporation</link></u> -- Generally players should be scrapping their items for Credits unless they're dedicated to becoming a crafter.

You will earn crafting skill each time that you make an item. This skill directly improves the quality of crafted items: Items can have quality from 1 to 255 with each point improving the item's <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> by 0.1%, giving a difference of 25.4% between the worst and best items of the same rarity.

There are 6 item crafting skill categories: Scientist, Engineer, Weapons, Armor, Shields and Drones. Scientists build Engines and Special-type items, while Engineers build Computers, Batteries and Storage items. Most Engine and <u><link="Item Types">Special-type items</link></u> only enter the game through crafting or unique events.

Outside of <u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u> there is rarely loot with quality higher than 100. Only skilled crafters can produce the most powerful gear, and only after a significant amount of effort.

Item crafting is intended to be a long-term player goal with a timeline of years. Only a few dedicated players will ever reach Masterwork crafting ability, but their products will fetch a premium with the highest demand. All items are tagged to display who created it.

You can queue up several item crafts by clicking a blueprint multiple times.

Type :CRAFT into chat for management commands, such as clearing your crafting queue or setting a lower skill rank for your next craft.

[[[Ship Crafting]]]
<u><link=”Corporations”>Corporations</link></u> level up their <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Shipyards</link></u> to unlock new <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> blueprints for members to use.

Corp leadership may select a single faction (Pirate, Het, Wyrd, Precursor) for each Shipyard to specialize in, opening up production options for advanced alien-class ships. These alien blueprints have access to different <u><link="Technology">technology</link></u> more powerful than human ships, but are also more expensive to build.

<u><link=”Ship & Defense Unit Size”>Larger ships</link></u> have more <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Points</link></u>, allowing them to use more powerful items. Advanced ships can require <u><link=”Skulls”>Skulls</link></u> and <u><link=”Relics”>Relics</link></u> in addition to basic crafting resources.

When you craft a ship it gains a random Ship Stat Bonus Mod. You can measure how powerful this bonus is by how many <u><link="Skills">Skill Points</link></u> it would take to gain an equivalent bonus. The random roll for a ship's crafted Stat Bonus Mod is between 3 Skill Points and 12 Skill Points, with the maximum only possible during rare <u><link="Daily Events">Daily Crafting Events</link></u>. Ship Stat Modification items can be found as loot, allowing players to replace this crafted stat bonus.

Building a ship increases your corporation's crafting skill for that particular faction type. For example, building a Wyrd Reaper will increase your corp's Wyrd Ship Crafting Skill. Corporations may earn up to 1,000 total ship crafting skill points per day. Ship Crafting Skill increases the Ship Stat Bonus Mod described above.

[[[Relics]]]
Relics are a rare <u><link="Ship Crafting">ship crafting</link></u> component used to build Assassin, Hades, Carrier and Emperor-Class <u><link="Ships">ships</link></u>. Each alien faction has its own type of relic for building its specific ships at <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Corporation Shipyards</link></u>.

Relics can be found in many different places! You might discover them as loot from NPCs, from <u><link="Free Daily Gifts">Free Daily Gifts</link></u>, from special <u><link=”Holiday Events”>Holiday Events</link></u>, as a reward in <u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u>, or earned every 5 Levels starting at Level 15.

Most relics come from the <u><link="Alliances">Alliance Wars</link></u> by <u><link="Corporations">corporations</link></u> fighting over territory and capturing Shrines with their <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Garrisons</link></u>. Each corporation may control 4 Relic Shrines, with a maximum of 10 shrines total for any alliance. Captured Shrines generate one relic at 100% progress:

Massive Shrine: 78 minutes per 1%
Huge Shrine: 86 minutes per 1%
Large Shrine: 95 minutes per 1%
Other Shrines: 104 minutes per 1%

Each player has an Alliance Point counter that goes up with any kill, PvP battle, defense unit fight, Arena victory or other event that brings glory to the Alliance! Players with the most Alliance Points get priority when Alliance Relic loot is distributed. Once someone receives a relic, their Alliance Point counter resets so other players have a chance for the next one. Click the STATS button on your Captain Panel to see your current Alliance Points.

- Relics can be traded and sold like any resource.
- USE a relic item to add it to your crafting bank.
- BUILD a relic with your captain's ITEM CRAFTING button.
[[[Alliances]]]
Several <u><link="Corporations">Corporations</link></u> may join together as a single team, forging an alliance that captures territory and <u><link=”Relics”>Relics</link></u> in a never-ending galactic war! Each alliance shares a chat room, <u><link=”Missions”>Missions</link></u> and <u><link=”Corporate Defender Ships”>Corporate Defenders</link></u>. All players in an alliance are friendly in <u><link="Player vs Player Combat">PvP systems</link></u> (except for <u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u>).

'Alliance Citizens' are any player Level 25+ in a corporation, who have logged in within the last 15 days. An alliance may contain up to 6 corporations with a max of 180 Alliance Citizen players between them (100 on Universe #2). Corporations cannot invite players once the citizen count is maxed, however they can always invite new players under Level 25. Players who haven't logged in for 15 days do not count against the Alliance Citizen cap.

Each player has a single 'Primary Alliance Citizen' character, which is their highest level character. This is used in certain mechanics where having multiple characters in different alliances causes game balance concerns, such as alliances capturing Security Rating 8 maps.

Click the 'STATS' button on the Corp Panel to view alliance and citizen details.

Corporations may transfer Corp <u><link="Tech Points">Tech Points</link></u> to other corporations in the alliance. Use the :ALLIANCE command in chat for details.

Alliance Leaders (Commanders of the primary corporation) will find Invite and Kick buttons on other Corp's panels, and member corporations will find a 'Leave Alliance' button on their panel.

All players in an alliance are stunned for 30 seconds when another corp joins or leaves, and changes cannot be made while defense units are under attack.
[[[Missions]]]
Each captain can have up to three missions at a time. Additionally, each <u><link="Corporations">Corporation</link></u> provides a shared Corp Mission and <u><link="Alliances">Alliance</link></u> Mission. Everyone in the game also works together on one Universal Mission!

- You can delete up to 3 missions <u><link="Daily Events">per day</link></u> to get new ones.
- Corp Missions are progressed by all corp members.
- Alliance Missions are progressed by all alliance members.
- You must participate in shared missions to get a reward.
- Leaving your Corp resets shared mission participation.

Mission Types:
- Kill Normal NPCs
- Kill Elite NPCs
- Kill NPC Leaders
- Kill NPC Defense Units
- Kill Players
- Harvest Resources
- Explore Solar Systems

Missions to kill "Aliens" mean any NPC enemy, including Pirates. <u><link=”Corporate Defender Ships”>Corporate Defenders</link></u> do NOT count for mission kill credit.

When killing Elite NPCs, they progress missions by 1 point per <u><link="Elite Ranks">Elite Rank</link></u>. For example, a 3-Star Elite NPC will progress your 'Kill Elite NPCs' mission by 3 points.

When killing Players for a mission, only kills outside of <u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u> count and only when a <u><link=”Skulls”>Skull</link></u> is earned. Only 1 point of progress can be earned per kill, per mission.

Corporations may cancel their missions using the :CORP and :ALLIANCE chat commands.
[[[Equip Points]]]
<u><link="Ships">Ships</link></u> and <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Defense Units</link></u> of different <u><link=”Ship & Defense Unit Size”>sizes</link></u> have a limited amount of space for attaching equipment items: This capacity is represented by the Equip Point system.

Most items have an Equip Point cost -- The sum of all equipped items cannot exceed a ship's maximum Equip Points!

An item's Equip Point cost can be manipulated through Upgrades, found on the Item Inspect Panel. Changing the rank of Weapons, Armor, Storage or Shields will modify their cost in exchange for more or less <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u>. Increasing the rarity of an item can often reduce its requirements as well.

There is a 1% chance any <u><link="Ship Crafting">crafted ship</link></u> will gain an additional Equip Point, and in very rare circumstances this bonus can even be +2 or +3!

[[[Pity Loot Drops]]]
Most item loot drops come from the Pity Loot System: Every NPC kill adds up until you eventually get an item! For example, after 7 or 8 kills you are "guaranteed" an UNCOMMON item. You're "guaranteed" a RARE after 33 to 40 kills, an ULTRA-RARE around 300 kills, and so on. NPCs can also just drop loot at any time -- If this happens, your pity counter for that rarity is reset.

We like to reward taking risks, so your pity loot counters go up faster in more dangerous areas! You won't see a lot of progress towards ULTRA-RARE loot until Security Rating 3, and you need to adventure further for ELITE, LEGENDARY and ULTIMATE loot drops!

The QUALITY of loot depends on the LEVEL of what dropped it, even if it was pity loot. Kill higher-level NPCs to get better quality gear!

<u><link="Player vs Player Combat">PvP Maps</link></u> add up Pity Loot faster and also produce a guaranteed rare <u><link=”Relics”>Relic</link></u> crafting component. Security Rating 8 maps receive a 25% loot boost and Security Rating 9 Homeworld Raids get double pity loot.

Note: Stealing items, invasion boss loot, killing <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">NPC defense units</link></u>, <u><link="Party Boxes">Party Boxes</link></u> and other non-standard loot does NOT reset your pity loot counters!

[[[Player vs Player Combat]]]
Players are safe from attack when in human-controlled systems, called PvE Maps, marked in BLUE on <u><link="The Starmap">The Starmap</link></u>. When you join a <u><link=”Corporations”>corporation</link></u> you also join their <u><link=”Alliances”>alliance</link></u>, placing you on a team in any PvP Maps with other players in that alliance. Friendly ships share vision, can follow or repair each other and attack enemies to split XP and loot.

With bigger risks come bigger rewards! <u><link="Pity Loot Drops">Pity Loot Drops</link></u> are boosted dramatically in dangerous areas, along with XP and Resource gains. Adventurous captains will see around 10% more XP and 20% more loot when hunting in PvP Maps.

Corporations may deploy their <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">defense units</link></u> in any system. Most PvP Maps contain a Shrine that can be harvested to gather <u><link=”Relics”>Relics</link></u> for your alliance -- Corporations may place a <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">Garrison</link></u> on the Shrine to capture that map and collect its relics.

You are relatively safe from attack at any defense unit owned by your corporation, however all bets are off if it comes under attack! You are also safe at Jump Gates between systems, but only if you are not flagged in combat! <b>Remember: You are never 100% safe in PvP maps!</b>

There is a damage-over-time mechanic called "Collision" which prevents too many ships from stacking in a single sector. This is to protect the game from excessive network and server lag. Collision is triggered under these rules:
- More than 225 total ships in a sector
- More than 75 ships per alliance
- More than 75 enemies attacking a defense unit (any alliance)

Note: Intergalactic Love Days are a special <u><link="Daily Events">Daily Event</link></u> which prevents open-world PvP. All players work together during Love Days!
[[[Ship Mods]]]
There are 8 consumable items which can permanently modify your <u><link="Ships">ships</link></u>. Once applied, ships gain new bonuses and <u><link="Technology">technologies</link></u> that may be improved further through the <u><link="Elite Ranks">Elite Rank</link></u> system. To preview how a ship is modified, use the item on a ship but CANCEL the final confirmation popup.

- Medic Ship Mod: Adds Repair Speed and <u><link="Technician">Technician Technology</link></u>.
- Gladiator Ship Mod: Adds Vorpal and Savior Technology
- Phoenix Ship Mod: Adds Rebirth and Savior Technology
- Raider Ship Mod: Adds bonus damage vs Players and Defense Units.
- Interdictor Ship Mod: See the <u><link="Interdictor Carrier">Interdictor Carrier</link></u> article.
- Freighter Ship Mod: Adds large resource harvesting bonuses but reduces damage.
- Paladin Ship Mod: Adds max hull and defensive technology.
- Ultimate Ship Mod: Adds +4 <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Points</link></u> and unlocks additional gear slots.

The Gladiator Ship Mod guarantees critical attacks against injured enemies and critical repairs on injured friends. Earn a Gladiator ship mod and titles for every 100 victories in <u><link=”Skulls”>The Arena</link></u>.

The Phoenix Ship Mod converts fatal damage into a large repair and instant cloak, while also improving repairs on injured friends. Phoenix Rebirth works for PvP and PvE deaths, with separate cooldowns for each. You can earn a Phoenix ship mod and titles by killing Invasion NPCs. Phoenix cannot be used on <u><link="Hardcore Ships & Defense Units">Hardcore Ships</link></u> and ships with Phoenix cannot go hardcore.

The Ultimate Ship Mod is crafted from "fragments" dropped as loot by <u><link="Corporation Defense Structures">NPC Defense Units</link></u> or harvested from <u><link=”Relics”>Relic Shrines</link></u>. You may only have one deployed Ultimate Ship at any time.

The Paladin Ship Mod is only created when any Emperor-Class Ship is <u><link="Ship Crafting">crafted</link></u> as an additional bonus result.

Except for Interdictor, ship mods can be applied to any ship without limitations. Although generally permanent, they may be reclaimed with <u><link="Tech Points">Tech Points</link></u> on the ship's detail panel.

Crafting the Ultimate or Interdictor Ship Mods requires identical fragments and Relics all from the same faction, however there is no difference in the final crafted item between factions.

The <u><link="Deception Module">Deception Module</link></u> hides equipped gear, resists and other <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u>. It does not replace or conflict with other ship mods.

[[[Junker]]]
Junker technology can trigger a hull repair any time an attacker deals damage, including drones, splash, and battle ram. It will repair the attacker for 33% to 100% of the total hull damage dealt, although it will not trigger if total damage is less than 30. Junker does not benefit from other technology like Technician or +Hull Repair stat.

[[[Deflector]]]
Deflector technology provides a chance to negate all incoming damage, and returns it back to the attacker. The damage negated is always 100% and not random. The dice roll for deflector chance happens after Hit/Evasion and Critical is rolled, during the final damage step. Deflector can trigger on any type of damage, such as drones, splash, and battle ram. Deflected damage behaves like an attack: It benefits from <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> like Outgoing Damage Bonus, Shield Pierce, etc.

[[[Technician]]]
Captains can improve <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> repair ability with the Technician <u><link="Technology">Technology</link></u> line, acquired through the Technician <u><link="Item Types">Special Item</link></u> or the Medic <u><link="Ship Mods">Ship Mod</link></u>. Upgrading the rarity of a Technician Special adds more abilities, as does increasing the <u><link="Elite Ranks">Elite Rank</link></u> of a Medic ship.

Technician Rank 1: Remove negative status effects from ships
Technician Rank 2: Repairs can critical
Technician Rank 3: Repairs can splash to other nearby ships
Technician Rank 4: Repair-over-time (ROT) effect with any repair

Technician Rank 1 adds an additional Purge button to any friendly ship with a negative status effect. Clicking this removes their negative effects and triggers an 8-second cooldown to purge again. Normal repairs do NOT remove negative status effects.

Critical Repair and Splash Repair use your ship's Critical Chance and Splash Chance <u><link="Stats">stats</link></u> to trigger in the same way that attacks do.

Technician Rank 4 repair-over-time effect lasts for 21 seconds, restoring 50% additional hull from the repair which triggered it. Ships with a repair-over-time effect cannot be <u><link="Grapple Ability Action">grappled</link></u>, <u><link="Hacking Ability Action">hacked</link></u> or <u><link="Taunt">taunted</link></u>, making this one of the most powerful counter-strategy abilities in the game. Existing negative effects are removed with the first pulse of the repair-over-time.

Technician technology will allow repair drones to remove negative effects, but they cannot splash or apply repair-over-time.

[[[Taunt]]]
The Tank Special Item gains a unique Taunt ability at Ultra-Rare Rarity and above, forcing damaged enemies to attack the tank. This target change happens automatically on any HIT or CRITICAL attack from the tank and lasts X seconds depending on the rarity and quality of the Tank item. It does not trigger on SPLASH or other types of damage, but it can splash during a special daily event.

This forced target change also triggers a new <u><link=”Ship & Defense Unit Size”>Target Lock</link></u> cooldown for the victim as with any attack target change.

The <u><link="Technician">Technician Technology</link></u> line can remove Taunt, while also applying a Repair-Over-Time bonus that protects the victim from negative effects for 21 seconds.

[[[Grapple Ability Action]]]
Once a <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> has 10 or more Grapple Chance stat it can use the Grapple hotbar action. This consumes 25% of the ship's battery. Grappled targets lose 25 Evasion stat and cannot move.

There is no dice roll when Grappling -- Grapple Chance increases duration of the effect, while Grapple Resist reduces duration. If the duration is reduced below 2.5 seconds there is a 50% chance to resist the Grapple entirely. If the duration is reduced below 1 second the Grapple is always resisted.

Evasion factors into resisting Grapple -- 5 Evasion is equal to 1 Grapple Resist. (Players Only)
Hit Chance factors into Grapple Attacks - 5 Hit Chance is equal to 1 Grapple Chance. (Players Only)

The base Grapple duration time is 4 seconds, plus 1 second for Advanced Grappling, plus 2 seconds for Advanced Grappling II. Each point of Grapple Chance increases duration by 1%. Each point of Grapple Resist reduces duration by 2% (or 1% for NPCs). This means that a Grapple Resist of around 25 is needed for a chance to fully resist versus +10 Grapple Chance. Each point of Grapple Resist counters 2 points of Grapple Chance.

"Reverse Grappling" technology reverses Grapples back at the attacker 50% of the time, using the target's Grapple Chance (even if less than 10).

Advanced Grappling III technology allows the grappler to drag a target to another sector when moving. This comes from the Grappling Hook special item and <u><link="Elite Ranks">Elite Rank</link></u> 3+ Cruiser ship class.

[[[Hacking Ability Action]]]
Once a <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> has 10 or more Hack Chance stat it can use the Hack hotbar action. This consumes 25% of the ship's battery. Hacked targets cannot use any hotbar ability except Repair, their battery does not regenerate, special movement speeds from engines and Space Lanes don't work.

There is no dice roll in hacking -- Hack Chance increases duration of the effect, while Hack Resist reduces duration. If the duration is reduced below 2.5 seconds there is a 50% chance to resist the hack entirely. If the duration is reduced below 1 second the hack is always resisted.

Evasion factors into resisting hacks -- 5 Evasion is equal to 1 Hack Resist. (Players Only)
Hit Chance factors into Hack Attacks - 5 Hit Chance is equal to 1 Hack Chance. (Players Only)

The base hack duration time is 4 seconds, plus 1 second for Advanced Hacking, plus 2 seconds for Advanced Hacking II. Each point of Hack Chance increases duration by 1%. Each point of Hack Resist reduces duration by 2% (or 1% for NPCs). This means that a Hack Resist of around 25 is needed for a chance to fully resist versus +10 Hack Chance. Each point of Hack Resist counters 2 points of Hack Chance.

"Reverse Hacking" technology reverses hacks back at the attacker 50% of the time, using the target's Hack Chance (even if less than 10).

Advanced Hacking III technology will disable a target's Special Item abilities like Nova Device and Deflector. It will also purge the Repair-Over-Time immunity granted by <u><link="Technician">Technician</link></u> and apply a hack to the target.

[[[Drain Ability Action]]]
Once a <u><link="Ships">ship</link></u> has 10 or more Drain Chance stat it can use the Drain hotbar action. This does not require battery power to activate. Drain attack steals some of the target's shields and battery power, making their weapons and other abilities inaccessible.

There is no dice roll when Draining -- Drain Chance increases the amount taken, while Drain Resist reduces how much is lost. If the amount is reduced below 3 Battery damage there is a 50% chance to resist entirely. Amounts less than 1 Battery damage are always resisted.

Evasion factors into resisting Drain -- 5 Evasion is equal to 1 Drain Resist. (Players Only)
Hit Chance factors into Drain Attacks - 5 Hit Chance is equal to 1 Drain Chance. (Players Only)

The base drain amount is 5 Battery, plus 2 for Advanced Draining, plus 4 for Advanced Draining II. Each point of Drain Chance increases amount taken by 1%. Each point of Drain Resist reduces amount taken by 2% (or 1% for NPCs). This means that a Drain Resist of around 20 is needed for a chance to fully resist versus +10 Drain Chance. Each point of Drain Resist counters 2 points of Drain Chance.

"Reverse Drain" technology reverses Drains back at the attacker 50% of the time, using the target's Drain Chance (even if less than 10).

[[[Small Strike Team Bonus]]]
When a fleet of 4 or more <u><link="Ships">ships</link></u> is composed of at least 33% <u><link=”Ship & Defense Unit Size”>Small or Medium Size Craft</link></u>, they unlock the Small Strike Team benefit, granting a 5% bonus to Outgoing Damage and +5 to all resists for the entire fleet (not just the small ships).

This effect intends to incentivize small ships in fleet combat and squad-based tactics instead of large single stacks.

[[[Interdictor Carrier]]]
The Interdictor is a powerful <u><link="Ship Mods">Ship Mod</link></u> crafted from your captain's Item Crafting panel. This allows a Carrier-Class ship to convert into an Interdictor, permanently replacing the Carrier's Leadership bonus.

Interdictors project a penalty to nearby sectors that increases enemy targeting and movement speeds by up to 30%, plus remove other movement effects like Space Lanes. The strength of this effect grows with the Carrier's <u><link="Elite Ranks">Elite Rank</link></u>. Unlike the Leadership effect, only one Interdictor can have influence per sector. This is assigned to the first to arrive OR the most powerful Interdictor Technology Rank -- Others Interdictors arriving later (or with lower tech) suffer the penalty like every other enemy ship.

The Interdictor effect disrupts any benefit from Space Lanes, but does not work in The Arena.

Crafting the Ultimate or Interdictor Ship Mods requires identical fragments and Relics to all be from the same faction, however there is no difference in the final crafted item between factions.

[[[Gravity Drives]]]
The Gravity Drive is a <u><link="Item Crafting">crafted</link></u> <u><link="Item Types">engine</link></u> with a unique "Instant Jump" ability. Each move has a chance to be free, causing the ship to arrive with no movement cooldown in the next sector. This also negates movement penalties like <u><link="Interdictor Carrier">Interdictor</link></u>.

When a ship with Gravity Drive is leading a fleet, all ships following it with a Gravity Drive equipped will trigger their own instant moves, allowing Gravity Drive fleets to move together. Ships with the Leadership ability (such as Carriers) use special rules: They will quick-jump every ship following them (with or without Gravity Drives) but at a slower speed than "instant" Gravity Drive jumps.
[[[Mutate Item Kit]]]
Captains may <u><link="Item Crafting">craft</link></u> the Mutate Item Kit for use on a piece of equipment. These kits target a specific <u><link="Item Types">item type</link></u> which is randomly selected when crafted. Once used, the kit is consumed and the target item may <b>never</b> be mutated again! Although mutations are permanent the bonus is always positive. Mutate also increases the scrap and deconstruct value of an item by 50%.

Mutations randomly select a stat to improve using a strength rarity:
32% Basic Mutation Chance
30% Uncommon Mutation Chance
20% Rare Mutation Chance
10% Ultra-Rare Mutation Chance
5% Elite Mutation Chance
2% Legendary Mutation Chance
1% Ultimate Mutation Chance

Each tier of mutation strength generally equals 0.5 <u><link="Skills">Skill Points</link></u> worth of benefit, so an Ultimate Mutation is like adding 3.5 extra Skill Points to your ship! There is a very rare chance of an <u><link="Equip Points">Equip Point</link></u> mutation which can add +1, +2 or even +3 Equip Points to an item!

<b>RE-MUTATE ITEM KITS</b>
Captains can re-roll a mutation using the Re-Mutate Item Kit available from <u><link="Reward Point Gifts">Reward Point Gifts</link></u>. This is guaranteed to improve mutate rarity but still picks a random stat!

Mutate bonuses are similar to, and stack with, <u><link="Void Items">Void Item</link></u> bonuses.
[[[Spaceball]]]
Please note: Spaceball may not be available in some countries or app platforms.

Spaceball is a simulated game of chance using in-game currency (not real money). It is simple to learn and easy to play!

Open CHAT and select the SPACEBALL tab to begin.
- There are 38 numbers on the table: 1 to 36, plus "0" and "00"
- Numbers 1 to 36 alternate as either RED or BLACK
- "0" and "00" are GREEN numbers
- The Spaceball rolls every minute to select a number!
- Bets can be placed any time before the roll
- Bets continue even if you close the chat window

To place a bet, click on a number or betting field on the table.
- Select how many Credits or Tech Points to bet
- Winning bets payout immediately on the roll
- Winning bets are returned to you with the payout
- Losing bets are removed from the table
- Click a bet at any time to take it back

The bet dialog will also let you select a "Repeat Bet" count. This will re-place the same bet if it loses (even if you close the chat window).

Betting on any single number is called a "Straight-Up Bet" and has the best payout, but is the most risky. You will also see several other bets, such as EVEN or ODD and RED or BLACK. These types of bets are much more safe and best for beginners.

-=[ Spaceball Payouts ]=-
Straight-Up Bet: 35 to 1
1st Dozen (1-12): 2 to 1
2nd Dozen (13-24): 2 to 1
3rd Dozen (25-36): 2 to 1
RED or BLACK: 1 to 1
EVEN or ODD: 1 to 1
