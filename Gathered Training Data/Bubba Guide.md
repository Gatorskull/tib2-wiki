Intro
 
	Welcome to TIB, if you are reading this, I'm going to assume you are new to tib, and well there is a lot to go into. In short, gearing your ships properly is 99% of this game, if you do it improperly, you will struggle as you progress. This guide covers from bare bones all the way up to the complex topics. If you want to conquer the galaxy, you have to have good gear. This breaks down the individual parts of gearing and how to gear a simple ship with starter gear, then goes more in depth about the why and technical aspects and meta gear. For returning tib1 players, there is a lot of small tweaks, but the biggest, fast guns are no longer kings.

	
So when you first start out, you are stuck with just a striker gunboat, it does not have a lot of equip points, and not a lot of slots, nor a lot of stats, it's your first ship, so pretty meh

And well, the 3 most important things in a ship are equip points, slots, and stats. So starting out with the first thing EP how do you allocate your EP
 
EP Allocation

How you allocate your EP is very important, doing it right can make or break it. Overall you should be focusing on just 2 things for all your EP, main slot gun, and hull, that's it, don't invest EP really anywhere else except for 4ep into a hold, and a main slot drone, so starting out:


Guns

Gun are rather simple 1ep = 1dps plain and simple, for example the starting gun, the Auto cannon

One of the worst guns in the game due to well, take a look at the stats, but if you take a look at just the EP, its taking up 1 EP of the 8 EP the gunboat has and in return deals 10.4 DPS 
And now if you derank it to 0ep, it deals 9.4 DPS

So 1 EP = 1 DPS
Which isn't a lot
If you were to focus all 8ep into the main slot, you are spending 100% of your EP for only a ~50% increase in DPS
And that is just considering the main slot gun
If you consider 3 auto cannons all shooting at the same time, 
9.4 * 3 = 28.2 dps
Vs
36.2 dps
A 22% difference for 100% of your EP
Will follow up more on a good ratio of how much EP to invest later.

So how much and where should you, well take this example

Go find an NPC, and start shooting it, when you first click to shoot, all your guns show up in the bottom right corner, and then tick down one by one, first main weapon to last. So take this EP allocation example


Why put a 15EP gun at the back of the list when it's going to take forever for its turn to even take a chance at shooting
If you take a look at the damage difference
Striker - IV - 0 equip points = 44-93 damage per shot
Behemoth - XXI - 15 Equip points = 192-394 damage per shot
Just look at the damage difference, this is why, for guns, you typically want to have a curve biggest and hardest hitter at the front, going downwards from there 2nd best gun, then 3rd, etc etc.



Here is a chart to visualize what is best for EP allocation for guns, you want your first gun to have all the EP hitting as hard as possible as that's going to be the gun constantly on cooldown first, and shooting first, and then the rest should be hitting for a least 75 damage (reason for 75 dmg is because it requires 75 damage to trigger a splash) 
As you will learn while fighting in the galaxy, you move a lot, which resets target lock. Putting all your EP into your main gun this allows you to deal all your damage at once, then get out of there before they can shoot you with their full burst. Which if you take a look at NPCs, gear, their EP allocation is flat, all guns will pretty much hit the same. So the longer you sit with them, the more guns that target lock on you, so the more guns that hit you, the more damage they will deal. So always keep on your toes with NPCs, it resets their target lock making them deal less damage. That is why all your gun EP invested should be the main slot only
Here is what a decent line up looks like
So, have all your EP invested into your first gun, and all your auxiliaries, be 0ep, and preferably, at least 75 damage, and also highly preferred, +1ep stat as you get +1 ep for each gun, that's a LOT more EP.
So now your gunboat should look something like this, 
NOTE: this is just an example of junk gear found. In a real scenario, you should ask your corporation for advice and gear to help gear properly, there is also more to consider, this is just EP allocation, don't focus on the items it self which gets covered later. If you want to know what guns are good, skip down to weapons

In this picture, all EP goes into the front gun, and then 2 0 Ep guns that give +1ep each, giving the gunboat now 10EP instead of 8EP. Now when i jump into a fight, my first gun will shoot of a nice blast of 100 damage, dealing ½ -¼ of the hull of most npcs in SR 1-2

Hulls

Next Part is hulls, now these are much more simple as more EPs, more hull, and thus longer you survive. This is more of a recommendation for how much hull to have for what SR you are farming.
These numbers are derived from a rare defensive hull  at normal quality, if you get gear from corp, you can easily invest a lot less EP into hull, allowing you to invest more into your main gun to farm faster.
Sr 1 - 2,000 hull - 1EP
Sr 2 - 3,000 hull - 4 EP
Sr 3 - 3,500 hull - 5 EP
Sr 4 - 4,000 hull - 6 EP
Sr 5 - 5,000 hull - 10 EP
Sr 6 - 6,000 Hull - 15 EP

Now this is what your ship should start looking like. This will allow comfortable sr2 farming. But lets say you invest all your EP into hull and go up to 4k hull. That does not mean you can now farm SR4, as your killing power is going to lack that NPCs will most likely out heal you. Have to have balance, find a good medium, you should be farming NPCs that are about 10-15 lvls higher than your player lvl for most XP gains.



Shields
Now shields are a little more simple and also a lot more complex, in short, do NOT put ep into your shield, shields are not good, they are really only for absorbing splashes, and nova explosions mainly, later down the line there are more uses, but more on that later.
As for what shields to use, that is covered later in the shields section later on.



Drones

Now the last and final, drones, now they are rather complicated as you can't rank them up or down like you can with shields, hulls, guns. but a couple of things i have found that works is
1. Only having 1-2 harvesters per ship (until you get a freighter) 0 EP ONLY
2. Only having 1-2 fighter drones per ship, starting out, just a couple EP into the first fighter
3. Don't invest too much EP into drones. 0 EP MEDICS ONLY

And with that, your ship should look something like this. And if you had an extra slot, there would be a harvester in the last slot.

And so yea, bigger ships = more EP = more hull and hitting power with your guns = faster killing = more xp = more ships = more killing, well you get the point.
And if you can't tell, more weapon slots also means more EP from +1ep auxiliaries, and more drones. Which is why slots are also very important.

There are other things to consider also like having a basic AT (Alien Technology) will give you 1 more EP, or having a toil can give more EP, but just follow the same rules. What is good specials and computers is covered later on. But in short
Aim for the hull minimums for the SR you are farming, find a happy medium
And put the rest into your main gun
NOTE: hull minimums go up if you do group play like pvp and busting, need at least 10k hull for most of those thing

That concludes EP allocation for starting out

Also, side note, the striker gunboat while small and as i said, crappy, as your invest skulls into it to put Elite ranks into it, gains slots and EP turning it into a potentially very powerful ship as it is fast, and so moves faster, and takes longer to get target locked take for example at max elite rank, plenty of slots and EP




Stats
Now 2nd most important, stats. Without them you are nothing, now there are a lot of different stats, and a lot of numbers when you look at them, but if you take the time to just understand them, your life will be a whole lot easier.
The most important stats are these.
Offensive - Critical chance, Targeting speed
Dmg buffs - Outgoing dmg, hull dmg, critical dmg
Defensive stats - Critical resist, Grapple Resist, Hack Resist

As stated before, jumping in, shooting quickly and hard and then scooting away is very powerful. And all of these stats make it possible
Shooting quickly comes from targeting speed, it reduces the time it takes to acquire target lock.
Shooting hard comes from the critical chance, and dmg buffs.
And then getting out alive comes from the defensive stats - critical resist to reduce chance of getting hit by a critical, grapple resist so you don't get pinned down, and hack resist for if you have a crux drive or some engine/special, not as important, but still nice.

These are the most important stats, but that doesnt mean go all in on them, all stats are very important, without a hit chance, you won't even be hitting them as they will be evading them. So all stats are important, but these are the most important. 
There is also DR (diminishing returns) so going all in, everything into crit chance, won't be as beneficial, near the upper curve, 10 crit chance will only give you 1, so a good balance is best.

Now this concludes the gist of equipping your ships, now the difficult part, getting actual good gear high quality, void S tier gear to to put on your ships, listed bellow this is a list of S, A, B tier gear, S being the best of the best gear that is very sought after, if you follow the EP guide, and you only get high quality S tier gear, you will prosper.


Quality / Voids

One last really important thing before giving you the list of gear to look out for. Quality, and voids matter a LOT. 
The math for quality is 
1 quality = 0.1%
So 256 quality is going to be 25.6% better then a 1 quality
And then voids at +10% stats
So thats a 35.6% difference

Take for example a osmium hull maxed out
11,411 hull


If it was not void, and not max quality
Looking at 3303 less hull, which a lot

Its such a big difference that a rare max quality void can beat a ultimate item


So keep in mind, rarity isnt everything, quality and void items are and so thats why on the market you will find ultimate items going for 35k

And then uncommon max quality voids going for 25k

So that is one thing to consider, do you buy high rarity, low quality for cheap, that you will replace. Or do you buy high quality, low rarity voids, that you will keep forever, and slowly upgrade bit by bit.
Which then it is extra important to consider the void stat you are buying, as they are expensive to reroll. And as covered in the stats, there is only 8 good stats, and those voids tend to sell for a lot lot more.

Last thing about quality, upgrading to max, 256 can be difficult, most gear on market is ~230 quality due to that being the level of crafters
At uncommon you have 5 augmentations up to ultimate that gives you 15 quality if you don't use + quality augmentations. Putting you at 245 quality, not 256. 256 quality is permanent gear, and sells for a lot more than 245, highly recommend that you plan ahead for your gear to hit 256 for augmenting gear up from lower rarities
The minimum quality possible is 211 at uncommon to reach 256 at ultimate, but takes 5 +9 augmentations which are rare on their own. So try to buy higher quality, will save you a lot of TP and hunting for +9 augmentations











WEAPONS

-OVERALL BEST-
-S Tier-
Graviton -  it is the best of all worlds, little bit of dmg bonuses, decent crit chance, lot of TS, and some EVA which can be really nice if not getting it from any other source




-B Tier-
Anullifier - really great gun, good dmg bonus, lots of crit chance, LOTS of hit chance, and shield pierce alright, but compared to graviton
The trade off is 17.5% less TS, 14 less evasion, for, 11.5 more hit chance, and 8 more crit chance
Making a huge difference


Dragon - Really good gun for getting splash for like a technician, as just raw 1:1 stats, it gives 28 splash chance vs the most crit chance you can get from a gun the anullifier is 21, it then is good all rounder, and gives a LOT of crit dmg


Matter Reverter - very comparable to the graviton, all stats are the same, but matter revert has  3.5% more TS, and 10.5% crit dmg instead of 3.1% hull dmg and missed out on the eva, otherwise solid gun, very close to the graviton




-OTHERS-
These are for unique builds

-Grapple Resistor - S TIER

Hellcannon - LOTS of grapple resist, making it very viable for say a tanky ship in need of grap resistance (honorable mention the inferno rifle, same grap resist, just dif stats)


-Grapplers- S TIER

Gravity smasher - most grapple power and some decent other stats as its the brother to the graviton


-Hackers- S TIER

Firecat - decent amount of hack power, decent all around stats, but really nice is the huge amount of hack resist it gets


-Resistors- A TIER

Trance/Radiance - Average all around good resistor



-Aux Weapons-

Eradicator - for aux weapons, stats don't really matter as aux slots only get 10% of stats, all that matters is attack speed, and +1 ep, and these are the best at both, also they give a lot of other nice stats, so 5 of these adds up to +10% more crit damage which is pretty nice, the best aux for min maxing


And also any Het Weapon - They are very nice because at it gives free repairs, it's worth to have at least 1, it's worth the the 1 less EP but only at elite+ otherwise it's pretty useless and that 1 ep would be worth elsewhere like hull or a repair drone


-Shields-

Shields are a little complex but there are only 2 good types of shields for 99% of use cases
v04, and v10
Plain and simple, just look for ONLY v04 and v10, human faction

Now if you want to get complicated, and really mathy about what EP to use at what shield etc. for lots of shield use V8s, and use V04s and 10s for good resists and damage reductions paired with a heavy hull, for the resist shields. Now getting technical shields, take a look at prec 08, ultimate at 6EP+ it beats any shield out, no shield gives more shield then a prec08, at 6EP+ but as soon as you rank it down to 5EP, then a wyrd08 beats it at 5EP, and then you go down to 4EP, then het beats wyrd, so on and so on. It becomes a trend of at a certain EP, there is a specific faction ship that will beat all the others at that EP, and this guide below tells you what EP that is.

(do note still is faction bonus which technically bring it up basically 1 faction for the guide so a het shield with faction bonus becomes comparable to a wyrd, so for equipping a wyrd ship, so for example, equipping a Ulti Het v10 on a het ship, using the guide it says 3ep to put it at, but since its a faction item, on a faction ship, it goes up a faction technically speaking, so instead you would want to do 4-5EP to maximize its potential)

TLDR: just do what it tells you to wear at what EP, and if you have the faction bonus, follow the guide for the 1 faction higher

Also just a reminder ONLY DO 0EP SHIELDS, and ONLY DO HUMAN V04 and V10
Could go into the reasoning, but would require a essay

-Specials-
-S Tier Offensive-

Advanced Munitions - huge amount of dmg bonuses making crits hit REALLY hard, and this thing is a beast


-S Tier Defensive/Support-

Technician - This is essential in a fleet, from healing a lot, and splashing others giving ROT which prevents grapples and hacks, its also very essential for repairing grapples and hacks, this is a must. Focus on this for your first special, and your second special


-A Tier Defensive/Support-


Deflector - S tier for putting on structures, and can be very useful for a very tanky ship


Advanced Construct - Great for Starting out, as at lower rarity, its +2 ep, gives a decent amount of hull shield, and xp bonus, great starting special


Tank - Now this does hurt your killing power a lot, so dont put it on a ship that is a killer, this gives 25% more hull, and a lot of grap resist, compared to the deflector which gives 15% chance to deflect, which just means 0 dmg, so they are very comparable.
However, in busts, tanks can be very very valuable, if you put it on a small ship, like a stinger, and you taunt 1 player, can make a huge differnce




-HOLDS-
Now holds are pretty basic, some factions have better holds then others, and here is the list of them, take a look at #1 vs #5 to see the difference, it's sometimes almost double the stats, at the same rarity, same quality, same hold.

As for what to use? 
Prec armory always at 4EP for the bonus drone slot, and pirate vault for tanky ships

But here is a list if you don't do one of those 2 holds
Hold - Evasion Chance
Prec Hold

Het Hold

Pirate Hold

Wyrd Hold

Human Hold



Vault - Incoming Damage
Pirate Vault

Het Vault

Wyrd Vault

Precursor Vault 

Human Vault

Arsenal - Targeting Speed
Precursor Arsenal

Wyrd Arsenal

Het Aresnal

Pirate Arsenal

Human Arsenal



Archive - Xp Bonus
Wyrd Archive

Pirate Archive

Het Archive

Precursor Archive

Human Archive









Armory - Critical Chance
Precusor Armory

Wyrd Armory

Het Armory

Pirate Armory

Human Armory





Munitions - Hit Chance
Het Munitions

Wyrd Munitions

Precursor Muntions

Pirate Muntions

Human Muntions





-Hulls-
Now hulls are pretty simple, as discussed in the intro, you are looking for mainly 2 important stats, critical resist, grapple resist, and hack resist so as expected, critical resist, grapple resist hulls and hack resist are best (not always hack tho, mainly just for like some special builds)

Also something to note, is there is defensive and offensive hulls, defensive hulls have double that off offensive hulls, but also make you move twice as slow, however something else to note is offensive hulls give hull damage, but not enough for it to be worth such a low amount of hull making it much easier to kill you.


S Tier Defensive Hulls

Citadel - Crit is pretty meta, so crit resists is pretty important


Osmium - Grapple will mess you up, so it's also really important







A Tier Defensive Hulls 

Composite - pretty important for if your ability is ESSENTIAL to go off, so it's harder to get hacked

Holocrine - Good for a tech ship, gotta be tanky so why not get more repair while your at it


Carbide - This is all right for a XP set, its not worth to go for it from the start however, as you are effecting your survivability which matters a lot at the start, but later on, it doesnt hurt for the extra XP gain



-Batteries-
Now batteries, there is a LOT of batteries, but in short here is what is best
S Tier Batteries
Voltaic - Volts are ESSENTIAL for carriers, and if you want a ship to hit max speed, but that's it, only need 1 for your carrier


Moltic - targeting speed is very nice, and crit resist







A Tier Batteries
Hydric - Has really good grapple power, and some evasion which is nice

Radionic - good grap resist, and crit resist, and shield capacity




-Drones-
So first off, Drones have a lower Base DPS then weapons do. Drones have a base of about 5dps while guns have a base of about 14 DPS HOWEVER, drones gain ~1.4 dps per aug while guns only gain 1 DPS yet. However again when augmenting, drones don't always get a reduction in EP. So taking a look at per EP. Guns gain 1 DPS per EP and in the comparison of drones, you can not rank up drones, the only way to “Rank up” a drone is by going a faction up, which also gains only 1 DPS per EP.
So what does this mean? Well it means, fighters aren't that worth to invest EP into.
Since they have a lower base DPS. and per EP they scale the same as guns, they aren't that great. BUT they do shoot right after the main gun, and take no battery, so they are really good for supplementing DPS, but not always


Vs


So why invest into a ulti dcd when you can put 3ep into a gun instead?
Well, the main slot. Drones still do give a lot of essential stats, and the more EP a drone takes, the more stats, in the following drones i list, they are very very good to have in a main slot for more stats
So they aren't completely useless. I recommend at least 1 dcd good fighter per ship (once you get enough EP).

Now moving onto medics, medics are essential, take half the DPS of a respective fighter, and that is their RPS (repairs per second). So they get half the RPS per aug, but they still get 1 RPS per rank up (faction up). And so if fighters arent good to invest lots of EP into because you can get more out of investing EP into guns, medics kind of are the same. However that doesn't mean neglect them, medic drones are still EXTREMELY essential to survivability high rarity low EP medics are essential. Listed further is a list of what rarity medic is 0 ep which is what you want to aim for.

TLDR:
since drones aren't good for DPS or RPS per EP, you are best off using 0ep drones and putting the EP elsewhere
However, since they give LOTS of stats, you will want 1 DCD fighter/medic in your main slot




So a good starting line up as explored in the intro
Couple of EP into the main fighter, then 0ep drones rest of the way

Late game good line up
DCD fighter, LCD fighter, 0ep HX medics all the way

AUX DRONES
(version doesn't matter much as they are auxs)
This is a list of all the drones that are 0 ep

FIGHTERS
Ulti - LCD fighter

Pirate fighter is the only 0ep fighter (other then human but it has 1.2 less dps)


MEDICS
Ulti - HX medic

Legendary and Elite - LCD medics

Basic - ultra rare - ONLY BAS V12, BAS V12 is the free drone, and for some reason it is 0EP no matter what, while the other bas are 1EP. so BAS V12

So this is what you should be running depending on what aug of weapons you have
Have no 0ep fighters? Well then throw on medics, also have like 1 harvester on each of your ship if you have the slots for pve farming, helps supplement your resources. However if you have a freighter ship, no point in running harvesters, only run harvesters on your freighter.








HARVESTERS
(V3 gives resource cap)
Ulti - WP harvester

Legendary and elite - HX harvester
Ultra Rare and Rare - LCD harvesters














MAIN FIGHTERS S TIER
DCD V2 - gives HUGE amount of crit chance which is really good


MAIN FIGHTERS B TIER

DCD V9 - Gives A LOT of splash chance, and other nice stats
DCD V5 - Gives A LOT of movement speed, however, movement is a neutral stat, but its still a fighter which will really help supplement your damage

DCD V12 - Gives A LOT of grapple power, and some added crit res on the side


MAIN MEDICS S TIER
DCD V4 - great for tanky ships, LOTS of hp, while not adding any movement speed, and gives A LOT of crit res


















-Computers-

There are a lot of different computers, 7, and they all have many different versions.
For starting out, I wouldn't recommend putting a computer on unless its a tech, so I will only be analyzing tech computers.

S Tier Comps


Warrior - the warrior gives a INSANE amount of dmg buffs, on top of that gives some critical resist, down side is the incoming dmg debuff, makes ya easier to kill, but not by a lot, only good to equip at high rarity and high quailty


A Tier Comps

Ice - Huge amount of splash change, and hull repair, all while giving some grapple resist, great for a technician



Toil - Great for some tanky ship, as it gives all the resists, and incoming dmg debuff, really nice also for the reverse grapple


Agent - Also great for a tanky ship, gives a lot of EVA and some hack resist, and some hull dmg so can still hit hard if need


Sage - not only 2 stats worth on this, the hull dmg, and the XP bonus, this makes a decent XP farm item, but thats it, do not use it for pvp, arena, nada







TLDR/Conclusion

In conclusion, it is fairly simple to focus on just the S tier gear, but it's not always easy to j u s t get S tier high quality void gear, they typically sell for a lot on market for this very reason. So you may need to use transitory gear, so when in doubt, settle for less, but don't invest in less.

The ultimate build should be at full ulti everything is

Main drone - DCD-V2 fighter
Second drone - LCD fighter
Medics - HX medics
Main gun - Graviton
Aux guns - foilers
Main battery - Moltic
Shield - Hum-v10 or v04
Hull - Osmium/citadel
Computer - warrior tech 3
Special - tech or muni

But you may not always have that lying around so alternatives

Main drone - DCD-V4 fighter
Second drone - lcd fighter
Medics - BAS or LCD
Main gun - Anulifier
Aux guns - quan tunnelers
Main battery - radionic
Shield - Pirate-v10 or 04 or het
Hull - composite
Computer - Ice tech 3
Special - Alien tech

Settling for second best still will be a really really good ship, but it wont beat the full S tier gear ship


There are also many variations you can do, like you have to build a carrier, or an interdictor, or small cruiser ships. Or freighter builds, but this should give a gist to figure out the rest
