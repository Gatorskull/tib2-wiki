Quick-Start Guide
Not sure what to do next? Start here! This is a list of priorities to get you up to speed!
Disclaimer: this is a loose list of milestones and goals to help smooth out some progression in the game, for specific game mechanics please refer to other sections within the guide.

Step 1: Reach level 15

This is quite easy to do using the basic ships and gear you get along the way. Map Sol entirely for a free extra Shuttle and follow the next "Map Mission" you get as long as it isn't into a PVP enabled zone. Make sure to turn on your Analysis player research! Make sure to use the ships you get from leveling.

Step 2: Acquire & Gear 4 Battleships

You will get your first Battleship for free upon reaching level 15. The others can be purchased from the auction house, crafted using the ship building option on any friendly building, or most often are given by stronger corp or alliance members.
Now that you have your 4 battleships, focus on getting them to be 1,500 Gearscore so that you can participate in Arena and PVP activities. The item rarity matters a bit more than the quality and durability does for reaching this milestone, but the base items are quite important.
I reccomend building something similar to this list:
- 0 EP Shield Rare+ (Blue)
- +3400 Hull Armor Ultra-Rare+ (Purple) - should be around 9-10 EP for "Fat" armors
- 0 EP Storage Elite+ (Gold)
- no comp is fine, cabal/toil acceptable
- 3x Battery Ultra-Rare+ (Purple)
- MAX EP YOU CAN FIT Rare+ Main Weapon Above 11.0 Second Cooldown (Blue)
- 2x 0 EP Uncommon Auxiliary Weapon With "+1 EquipPoint" stats (Green)
- 1x EA Rare+ Fighter, Medic, and Harvester Drones. Preferably BAS/LCD for least EP use.

This setup gives you a solid universal ship to use, while a bit slow by yourself joining up with corp or alliance members will greatly speed up the leveling process. Continue to follow the Map Missions, PVP zones are quite risky but an option now.

Step 3: Save... ALOT

Getting a Carrier is going to be your main priority, as of writing the average cost for a basic one is about 300k on market. You can also craft one for 8 Human Relics, 250 Skulls, and a few thousand of each resource type. This ought to be your main priority and unnecessary expenses should be avoided.

Step 4: Reach Level 35

Now that you're level 35 you can finally equip or purchase that carrier you've been saving up for, but now you need to get gear for it! The goal is to reach "-65%" Movement Cooldown, giving you a 3.5 second move delay between sectors. This is best done by having an item setup similar or better than this: Havok Computer, Gravity Drive or any of the basic movement engines, Scout/Advanced Propulsion Special, Voltaic Batteries, Accelerator/Syncronotron Weapons, and DCD-V5 Drones.
Having one of each of these items, at Elite+ (Gold) Rarity, in the main slot of your carrier should bring you close to, if not entirely -65%. You can also use a "Nanobot Charge Kit" to get an extra 10% movement speed with a low upkeep cost, and Hyperdrive is an option, but should be saved for emergencies.

Step 5: Choices...

At this point you should be relatively set up, and can start to think about improving your capabilities through different faction ships, specials, and specialized builds! I personally recommend you pick up these 3 Specials in order:
- Scout: Using this on your carrier, and upgrading to elite will give you a decent movement bonus and a decent power scan with good range, allowing you to more easily and safely navigate space.
- Prospector: Dedicating a single ship to be the resource harvester makes it alot easier to gather resources from debris while farming. You can either save these for ship crafting or sell them for credits.
- Technician: While greatly reducing damage at lower rarity, even just being able to purge status effects like grapple is incredibly powerful for saving ships from sticky situations. The higher the rarity the better, especially at Ultimate.

As for ships and specific builds, ask around your corp and alliance. Most people go the route of bigger = better, acquiring Hades ships to replace Battleships then eventually replacing those with Emperors
HUD
The hud is easily the most confusing and steep learning curve the game has to offer. It gives you all your information, whether you want it or not. Lets have a look at what you are likely to see when you load into the game on your preferred server.


From top left to top right you should see in order on the black bar:
Credits: this is the main tradeable currency of the game, you will need many millions in order to fulfill your dreams.

Skulls: obtained from player vs player activities, these are used to build or empower ships and structures.

Tech Points: The premium currency of the game, these are used for many actions and you will need lots in order to attain your goals. They can be purchased with Credits at a rate of 1,000 Credits -> 1 Tech Point.

Sol 7/7: Sol refers to the star system, the "map" you are currently in, and the sector grid coordinates of your currently selected ships position within. Most maps are 15x15 grids with missing sections.

Safe Zone: Indicates that the zone is free from player vs player encounters, safe zones are in the central sections of the map, with PVP zones as you get further out from the center of the universe.

% Explored: Sectors are only revealed when you are nearby or have already moved through them. Exploring a map entirely will permanently show the layout, but not all the contents within. Mapping zones gives you various rewards.

FPS: indicates the frame rate your game is experiencing

Ping: indicates your connection rate to the game server.

"UTC": stands for Coordinated Universal Time, which lets players from different timezones effectively organize events at a standard timezone.

In the top left corner you will also see your player portrait, your name, your corporation affiliation, your level, the "hamburger" menu, the chat button, and a list of your active ships. These are all things you will constantly be using in order to interact with the things you can easily control.

Now that the basic hud is explained, what you see in the center is the current map you are in, with structures, friendlies, visible enemies, debris and other various info.

In the top right corner you will see other entities, such as NPCs, Players, and Structures. This section is where you will be affecting the world in various ways.

In bottom left you will see the chat and event log, this gives you some quick info about what is going on in or nearby your sector, and various chat popups.

In the bottom right you will see your missions tab, your hotbar actions, and in combat will see weapon and drone cooldowns.
SETTINGS
Settings can be access from the Hamburger menu or by pressing the ESC key
The sections are Graphics, Gameplay, Sounds, and Keybinds.
Graphics, Sounds, and Keybinds are all personal preference, but Gameplay has some useful things you might want to change.

Recommended Settings:



These settings help me gauge my surroundings with as easily as possible without too much spam going on. I turn almost everything in the event filters off personally



HELPFUL COMMANDS
Ever get lost or need to check something? maybe one of these commands can help, simply type : and then a keyword into any chat. You can also type :help in game to get a list of these commands

Type in Free Gift and NewGiftTib2 in chat for some free bonuses as a new player!

:daily - displays current daily events, and your item upgrade bonus.
:info - pulls up your stat menu if no name entered, or you can enter a players name after and view theirs

:XFER CR/TP/SK (# Amount) - Costs 5% of the specified amount (will remove 5 of the 100, and transfer the remaining 95, for example), amount must be over 100, sends the selected currencies to the other universe.
MOVEMENT
Movement Commands:
To move your fleet simply click on a visible and connected sector and your ships will move to that sector. By default a left click only moves the selected ship, and right click will move your whole fleet. This can be reversed in the settings. Your ships will continue to move until they reach the destination, only stopping if the sector becomes disconnected by vision breaking or being delayed by grappling effects. You can tell your ships to follow one of your own, or an allied ship. This causes the ship being followed to be the one whose inputs matter, all the other ships will simply follow to the best of thier ability. Typically you want to set all your ships to follow your slowest and largest ship


Movement is divided into two sections: Animation Delay and Movement Cool Down.
Animation Delay is based off the size class of your ship and is not shown on the Movespeed Stat. Smaller ships will have very little delay from inputing a movement command to actually performing the sector jump compared to larger sized ships which can take over a second before actually performing one.
Movement Cool Down is the timer that must reach 0 before your ship can perform a new movement command. It is the number you can see on the stat sheets of your various ships. All ships have a base Movement Cool Down of 8.5 seconds, with the % modifiers changing based off that number. The lowest movement cool down you can reach is 3.5 seconds, at -65% movement speed.


Example of a ship with no Movement Cool Down Modifiers applied:


Example of a ship wearing a hull adding Movement Cool Down:

FLEET MANAGEMENT
Fleet Commands:
You can control individual ships by selecting them on the left side of your screen, then (by default) left clicking on a sector, enemy, or other action. You can control your entire fleet by right clicking on a sector, enemy, or other action.
If your selected ship has an action on cooldown, you can still press the button again and it will attempt to use one from another of your ships within the same sector, prioritized by strength of the action. IE a higher number Repair will go first, and a stronger Grapple Power will try to grapple first.
Driving around is typically done with the largest size class ship you own, which for most newer players will be a Carrier or Hades. If you do not own a carrier it should be done by having all of your ships follow the slowest moving ship in your fleet.

Individual Movement:
Commanding a single ship to act on its own IS possible by making it a "move all exclude", right clicking for actions on PC, or by having it be the only ship within a sector capable of a specific action. This can be quite useful for things such as entering with a specific ship first, or getting your hooks to move separately from the main fleet.

SECTOR EFFECTS
Not sure what this "weird red circle" is? Check here!

Star lane:
Starlanes are indicated by the blue lines connecting some sectors. All ships move 10/15/20% Faster depending on the strength of the starlane effect, a rule of thumb is as you get further away from friendly areas the weaker the effect becomes.


Carrier:
Indicated by a purple segmented octagon AND segmented lines connecting sectors, your ships will use the movement speed cooldown (NOT THE PRE-JUMP) of the fastest carrier avalible.


Friendly Territory:
Indicated by a Blue hashed zone on top of sectors, your ships will gain a 10% movement speed bonus and a +5 bonus to all resists.


Enemy Territory:
Indicated by a orange hashed zone on top of sectors, your ships will take 10% more damage and take a -10 Deduction to resists


Friendly Interdictor:
Indicated by a grey segmented octagon, enemies within have their movement speed and targeting speed reduced by 15/20/25% depending on the strength of the Interdictor


Enemy Interdictor:
Indicated by a red segmented octagon, allies within have their movement speed and targeting speed reduced by 15/20/25% depending on the strength of the Interdictor.


Friendly Nova:
Indicated by a large blue circle, up to 50 enemies take a large burst of damage at the end of the cooldown, and the center sector becomes on fire for X Seconds. Damage is dependent on the EP size and general modifiers of the ship that went nova.


Enemy Nova:
Indicated by a large orange circle, up to 50 allies take a large burst of damage at the end of the cooldown, and the center sector becomes on fire for X Seconds. Damage is dependent on the EP size and general modifiers of the ship that went nova.


Fire:
Indicated by a orange segmented octagon, all players within take damage every few seconds

Invasion Garrison:



Invasion Portal:






MAPPING & QUICK JUMPING
Mapping:
Fully explore every Star System you can. There are rewards and missions for completing them. Mapping Sol entirely gives you a free shuttle class ship, for example. As well as mapping every one from Security Rank 1 to Security Rank 7 giving you 3 powerful ship modifications.
Whenever you encounter a Jump Gate, make sure to study it. All Jump Gates within PVE zones can be instantly teleported to using the Quick Jump action


Quick Jumping:
Quick jumping is the act of spending 1 TP to teleport your currently selected ship and your others in the same sector, to a specific garrison or friendly building in space. You can teleport to any Jump Gate within a PVE zone as long as you have reached it before and studied it. Alliance buildings are always available to teleport to as long as they are deployed, even in PVP zones.



From left to right:
Occupied sector with a jump gate
Visible (Blue Ring) and Explored sector (Octagonal Shape)
Visible (Blue Ring) and Unexplored sector (Square Shape)
Spotted (Grey Ring) and Unexplored sector (Square Shape)

You can also temporarily see more sectors and connections when using the scan hotbar power. Quite helpful for mapping new areas.
SECURITY RATING
Security Rating:
Every map has a Security Rating, also known as SR or S, which determines the strength of NPCs in that map. The numbers range from S1 to S9, with S1 being the easiest.
As maps increase in rating the strength, level, and maximum number of enemies per sector increases. In S1 for example, only 2 enemies may occupy a sector before they will try to move away. Whereas S5 enemies may stack up to 6 at a time.
A good baseline for which rating you should be farming is the your maximum number of ships should be one above the rating you are in. So for S3 you should have 4 ships to safely navigate and solo farm.
RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
What are researches and techs:
Researches are personal time limited buffs to various stats and actions.
Technologies are in the same vein as researches, but can be granted through items, ships, corporations, and other effects such as random daily events.

How do you utilize researches and techs:
Researches can be turned on an off in the "My Research" tab through your player tab. I reccomend using Hyperdrive during Arena and Analysis during PvE Farming. Other researches are more geared towards PvP content, and should be used sparingly during such events.

Why you want to utilize researches and techs:
These small buffs can make a massive difference in your effectiveness as a player, but should not be relied upon for base things such as making a Carrier meet its speed cap. TIB2 is a numbers game at the end of it all, so every percentile counts.

Why aren't my bonuses stacking?
Technologies come in two forms, "RANK 1-9" and "I, II, III, IV, V"
Items with roman numerals will stack if you have multiple DIFFERENT versions. So "Repaid Speed I" WILL stack with "Repair Speed III"
Items with numbers will NOT stack if you have multiple different versions, and will only use the strongest version. So "Regeneration Rank 3" WILL NOT stack with "Regeneration Rank 7", you would only get the benefit from the Rank 7

*DISCLAIMER: SCAVENGER RANK TECHS NOW STACK BETWEEN ALL OF YOUR FLEET BONUSES*

Examples of researches:


PLAYER SKILL POINTS
What are skill points:
Skill points are a customization stat boost that applies to each and everyone of your ships that you acquire from leveling up and studying artifacts around the universe.

How should you use skill points:
In my opinion you should use skill points in this order:
10 into EXP
5 Hit Chance
5 Crit Chance
5 Grapple Power
5 Grapple Resist

After that its personal preference.

Why you should use skill points:
EXP will help you level up faster, and is basically always a safe stat to build. Hit and Crit both greatly improve your damage in combat, increasing the rate of XP gained as well. Grapples are the most important and most powerful hotbar action and having multiple ships being able to use the ability is crucial.

The various skillpoint options:


CORPORATIONS & ALLIANCES
Corporations:
Your time in space should not be spent alone, and thus you will eventually need to join or create a Corporation. Corps are the most basic form of grouping up with other players and dedicate efforts towards making, or destroying, important structures.
Alliances:
Alliances can be formed and broken between Corporations to further expand your influence.
As a new player I recommend joining an active Corp in a strong Alliance. Doing so will give you access to higher level players who can help in various ways for your growth in game.
RESOURCES, LOOT AND PITY DROPS
Resources:
Resources are the various little numbers you accrue inside your ship as you kill NPCs, harvest Debris, and loot from sectors. These can be deposited at any Friendly or Neutral structure into a bottomless bank which you can use at any time. The various types of resources are Crew, Organics, Gas, Metal, Radioactives, and Darkmatter. These can be scrapped into credits by first crafting bundles of 100, 500, 1000, or 5,000 however keep in mind that you can also auction these bundles for more than scrap value. Crew, Radioactives, and Darkmatter are often sold for higher than scrap value, while the others will take longer.


Pity Loot:
Every NPC has a small chance to drop an item of a rarity appropriate for that zone, but every NPC also contributes to multiple hidden counters for a pity drop. A Pity Drop occurs after you accumulate so many points without dropping an item of that rarity. You will get a basic item roughly every 4 NPCs for example, but you may have to kill 100s in order to earn a elite or legendary drop. The stronger the NPC you kill, the more points it will accumulate. This means farming S5 might take 10 hours to get an Ulti drop, compared to say 4 or 5 in an S7 zone.
GENERAL EQUIPMENT
Item stats are divided into Slot, Faction, Rarity, Quality, Durability, EquipPoints and Gearscore.
For example: This Accelerator is a Weapon Slot, Human Faction, Rare Rarity, 154 Quality, and at 91% durability.


Slot:
Every ship will have room for a Shield, Hull, Storage, Computer, Engine, Special, Battery, Weapon, And Drone. Depending on the class and faction of the ship, will gain addition auxiliary slots for batteries, weapons, and drones. Auxiliary slots give the full effect of the item, but only 10% of the stat. For example; A weapon in an auxiliary slot will still fire for its full damage, but will only give .1% damage bonus, instead of its typical 1%. Different items will give different bonuses, have separate damage and attack timers, and be used for different purposes.

Faction:
Every faction has a different thing it does better than another,Humans are relatively cheap, Pirates are good at using everything and stealing, Heteroclites are good at repairs and battery draining, Wyrds are good at shields and splashing, and Precursors typically have stronger stats and more space.Matching Shield and Hull with your ships faction can provide a slight bonus

Rarity:
Rarity is divided into 7 Ranks. Basic (Grey), Uncommon (Green), Rare (Blue), Ultra-Rare (Purple), Elite (Orange), Legendary (Red,) and Ultimate (White). Higher rarity means better stats, less equip points at the same size, and often other bonuses that appear at high ranks.

Quality:
Quality is a numerical value attached to the state of the item out of 256, with 1 being Terrible, and 256 being a Masterworks. Quality modifies the stats of the item up or down. The general rule is: At Item Quality 1, there is 87.2% of any effect, and at 255 Quality it is 112.8%. ALL items that have quality are affected by these changes, even things with dubious or hidden mechanics, such as Prospector and Alien Hunter effects.
Any effect that would usually be tied to a quality, but is given by a unique effect, is assumed to have 128 Quality.

Durability:
The numerical value of how long before an item becomes unusable and needs repairs. Items will not be broken, simply unequipped and unusable until repair. Every 20% durability you repair on an item will lower the quality by 1. Items already at 1 Quality are unaffected, and the 20% takes into account all repairs previous and total, meaning if you repair for 50 durability it will take 3 quality, but next time you repair for 50 durability it will only take 2, accounting for the 10 you already "paid" for.

EquipPoints:
Equip Points, or "EP" determine the "size" of the item, and the available room on the ship for bigger items. Larger shields and hulls give more shield and health, larger storages give more resource capacity, and larger guns will hit harder.

Gearscore:
"GS" is a approximation of the strength of the item. This takes into account the Quality, Rarity, and EquipPoints of an item. This score is used to determine if the ship is worthy for skulls gaining or granting in PVP, participation and team balance in Arena, and is a way to gauge the strength of an entire ship combined.



ADVANCED EQUIPMENT
Computers:
Computers come in 2 forms, Mark I through IV, and Tech I through III. Each type focuses on a different stat bonus.
Sage for XP
Toil for EP
Havok for Movement Speed
Cabal for Critical Chance
Ice for Splash Chance
Agent for Evasion Chance
Warrior for Damage Bonus

Mark computers all give the same upsides, with each different version giving different downsides. These are found easily and abundantly throughout the universe and are often not worth much outside of ultimate rarity variants.

Tech computers all give EP and the typical bonuses, with different other upsides and downsides compared to the Mark versions, but each rank increases the amount of EP given by that comp. Tech Computers are produced through the Arena, Invasions, Party Boxes, and certain daily events.

Deconstructing Computers will give you a % towards a stand Mark computer blueprint out of 100% like with standard items, but will also give you a flat number of 1 to 7 depending on rarity towards a Tech Upgrade Kit 1 at 1,000 points. The kit can be used to upgrade a Computer of that type to increase it from a Tech 1 to a Tech 2. Earning 5 of any Tech 1 Upgrade Kits also gives you a random Tech 2 Upgrade Kit.

Engines:
Currently there are 8 Engine types in the game.
Impulse, Fusion, and Atomic are all standard common engines that can drop rarely from NPCs, and give a normal bonus to Movement Speed and some resists.
Stealth Drive provides false item information to people inspecting your ships and has a chance to break targetting when moving between sectors.
Neutron Drive makes you immune to ram throw effects and has a chance to resist dragging from getting hooked. These are made when a Skip Drive is reduced to 0% Durability.
Skip Drive bypasses all movement animation delay and cooldowns making you as fast as possible, however these cannot be repaired and will eventually decay.
Crux Drive consumes crew resources in order to bypass movement cooldown, but you will still have the standard animation delay. These are the most popular and expensive engines in the game, for use in small fleets without carriers or in the arena where carriers do not function.

Deconstructing engines all give progress towards the same blueprint, which will produce a single random engine blueprint.


Specials:
VOID ITEMS & MUTATIONS
Void Items:
Void items get a random stat bonus that either adds a new stat or improves a current stat on the item. These bonuses scale with the rarity and quality of the item. Void items require a matching faction relic in order to upgrade, 1 to elite, 2 to legendary, 3 to ultimate. The random stat CANNOT be changed currently. Void items also have 10% better base stats compared to a non-void counter part of the same quality, rank, and rarity.
Sources for Void items are: The Arena, weekly Party Boxes, drops from NPC Structues, 1% of crafted items become void touched, and lastly any item that drops has a 1:5000 chance to be void.

Mutations:
Much like the bonuses that void items get, mutations are a random added stat or improvement to a current stat. The difference is that any item can be mutated using a corresponding mutation kit. Void items can still be mutated on top of the separate bonus. Mutations CAN be re-rolling using a re-mutate kit.

Void Mutations have a " ^ " next to them and normal Mutations have a " * " next to them on the item cards.

Possible stats:
+1/2/3 EP (1:750 for 1 EP and 1:3000 for 2 or 3 EP)
-Movement Cooldown
-Targeting Speed
+Hit Chance
+Damage
-Incoming Damage
+Evasion Chance
+Critical Chance
+Critical Damage
+Splash Chance
+Shield Perice

+Hack Resist
+Hack Power
+Battery Drain Resist
+Battery Drain Power
+Splash Resist
+Critical Resist
+Resource Capacity
+XP Bonus
+Power Recharge
+Power Capacity
AUCTION HOUSE & RAFFLES
Auction House:
The auction house is where players go to offload unwanted, unused, or otherwise unobtainable items. You can sort through various ship and item types to find the exact item you want, or view items that are close to expiring. Items can be bid on or bought out, with base prices determined by the seller. Keep in mind that items typically have an agreed upon value, but are not required to be sold at that amount.

Raffles:
As part of the auction system, 3 unique ships will be up to purchase in a raffle format. You can only buy 1 ticket per account per ship, and you must be a minimum of level 30 to purchase a ticket. Once the timer ends the ship is given randomly to one player who has purchased a ticket. These ships are still tradeable, so you may rarely see some secondhand from other players.
EQUIPMENT RESEARCH, BLUEPRINTS, AND CRAFTING
Equipment Research:
Most items can be "researched" in order to gain blueprint progress towards that item category. These can be quite specific such as Het Armors, or very broad like any Engine. Researched items are destroyed, and then give you a % progress that scales with the rarity, durability, and quality of the item. Research produces a blueprint once you reach OVER 100% progress, ie 100.01% or more
Hitting exactly 100% will NOT produce a blueprint until you Research an additional item.

Blueprints:
Blueprints are potential specific items that can be crafted later using resources. They are produced from research in sets of 10, or 1 in the case of engines and specials. They can also be looted from multiple daily events, typically in sets of 4 for most, and again only 1 for engines and specials. These items can be traded easily and freely, and represent a potentially high quality version of that item depending on the player crafting it.

Crafting:
Crafting items is the most consistent source of high quality items in the game. This requires you have have the relevant blueprint, a small amount of resources, and finally the required skill level to produce the quality you want. Slill is only gained by crafting items, so if you want to make say a 129 qual item, you would first need to have made 330 items of the same catagory. This can be expensive and time consuming but fortunately many players will craft high quality items for you, with a small price added.
HOTBAR ACTIONS
Hotbar Actions are the line of buttons along the bottom right of your screen:

Repair: causes your selected ship to repair ITSELF with the hotkey. ALL ships have the repair action. You can also click on the repair buttons on your own or ally ships under the names to repair that specific ship with whatever repair actions are avalible.

Scan: reveals sectors nearby, providing vision of any ships within, even if the sectors are not normally connected, and uncloaking ships of equal or lower power. Scan power can range from 1 to 7, and certain ships have scans that reveal longer ranges.

Cloak: causes the ship to cloak itself, removing itself from vision for enemies, and removing any targetting against it. Cloak power ranges from 1 to 7.

Grapple: latches onto the target ship, preventing it from moving. a ship requires at least 10 "Grapple Attack Power" to perform a grapple action at all, and rolls against the targets Grapple Resist to see if the action succeeds. Advanced Grappling rank 3 allows grappled targets to be dragged away with movement, and is indicated by a orange icon instead of a yellow one. Grappling a target greatly reduces their evasion chance.

Drain: removes a fixed amount of battery from target ship. Allowing you to focus down a specific target and prevent them from firing weapons or using hotbar actions in combat. Required at least 10 "Battery Drain Attack Power" to perform and is checked against Battery Drain Resist.

Hack: prevents the ship from using any hotbar actions, and stops the battery regeneration of the targeted ship. Requires at least "10 Hack Attack Power" to perform the action and is checked against Hack Resist. Advanced Hacking rank 3 prevents certain speical items from activating, such as technician effects and nova detonations.

Strike: (INFO TO BE ADDED, BUT ITS BASICALLY JUST A ON-DEMAND NOVA IN AREAS YOU CONTROL LOL)
COMBAT (PVE)
Space is full of non-player-characters, the vast majority of which want you dead. Combat is simply reducing their hull to 0 before they do the same to you.
Ships have 3 visible numbers or bars, Shield, Hull, and Battery.
Shield, displayed in blue, is the first layer of protection against damage, and most damage will be dealt to it first. Shield fully restores after a certain amount of time out of combat, and can also regenerate within combat. As long as you have some battery, your shields will regenerate 5% every 12 seconds, 10% if you are in a Wyrd ship, and another 3% if you have full battery.
Hull, displayed in red, is the actual health bar for your ships. Most investments into defense should be made into base hull amounts. The higher your hull the better, but stronger hulls typically incur slower movement. Hull can only be restored by player repairs and medic drones.
Battery, displayed in purple. is used to perform actions like firing your weapons and using hotbar actions other than repair. Battery slowly recharges at a fixed rate, it is recommended to disable weapons if your battery cannot yet keep up with your ships arsenal.

When an enemy is in your sector you will see something like this on the right side of the screen:
Clicking on the attack button will cause all of your ships in the sector to target the enemy and begin to attack. Actual attacks are delayed until the Target Lock finishes. Each weapon and drone must lock onto an enemy before it attacks. They do this in order from first to last, on a separate line for fighter drones.
Example of targetted enemy:

Example of one gun firing, while other is still locking onto target:

Once a weapon has fired, it will attack as soon as the cooldown period has finshed, providing it has enough battery

If your battery cannot keep up simply click on the icon of a weapon in the bottom right to disable that weapon, preventing it from firing, but still keeping the stats from the weapon.

COMBAT (PVP)
Player Vs Player Combat (PVP)
Open world player combat can occur at any point in a PVP zone, with some exceptions, and for any reason. Many players will often hunt by going through PVP enabled zones with scouts, looking for weaker players in order to kill for skull rewards. Other players will farm NPCs in these zones for the increased Resource and Loot drops that come with the zone.

Exceptions to Combat:
There are a few exceptions that allow players to be within a PVP zone, but not be targetable. This includes: standing on a jump gate, standing on a friendly building, and love day.

Standard Targets:
During PVP, the fleet driver will often call out specific target sorts, these are typically Fastest Movement, Smallest Hull, and Worst Gear. Other targets may be called out in order to target new or unprepared ships first, but killing carrier class ships first is the most consistent method of crippling an enemy fleet.

Shot Holding/Target Lock/ASAP:
When a targeted ship moves away from your sector, maintaining your target and re-entering a sector with them greatly reduces the targeting speed and often alligns multiple ships to strike at once, dealing great burst damage. If your driver calls to "hold targets", select a ship and do not let off the target until it is naturally dropped, or the ship is dead.

Interdictor Control:
During PVP maintain control over sectors using your alliances Interdictors can completely change the tide of battle. Interdictor control goes to the strongest technology ranking that is in or adjacent to the sector. If they are evenly matched, it goes to whoever was there first. Hacking an Interdictor will temporarity remove its effects, and will allow another to gain control over its sectors, this continues to work on a first to arrive basis, meaning it can either go to an ally or an enemy.
COMBAT (STRUCTURES)
NPC Structures:
Typically these will be attacked during Love Day, utilizing multiple stacks of player ships on a Rotation strategy to keep damage high and losses low. You have to go out of your way to actually attack a structure, so don't worry about a random alert when just clearing out random NPCs. These Structures always produce some form of loot for every player involved, with higher quality and rarity as the strength of the structure increases. You can also loot faction specific Relics and Oblivion Fragments from destroying NPCs structures.

When attacking an NPC structure 30 powerful NPCs will spawn in as defenders for the structure. These defenders make it difficult to kill the structure if left alone, but are not required to kill to destroy the structure. Defenders will respawn every 5 minutes if the structure remains in combat without being destroyed.

Player Structures:
The main benefit to destroying another alliances structures is the skull rewards associated with both the death of the structure, and the player defenders that will likely come to defend it. Some players will also focus on controlling specific maps for loot or movement reasons. Defeating a player structure can be difficult, and often requires at least two stacks rotating to accomplish the task.
COMBAT (INVASIONS)
Occasionally you will see a message in the chat along the lines of:
"[FACTION] invade [MAP] - Jump to [BUILDING NAME] (Difficulty, loot modifier, no PVP)"
This tells you what faction of enemies you will be fighting, what map its located in, and the name and quick jump point to join into the invasion.

You will be fighting through 20 waves of NPC assaults along with the rest of that server, with increasing difficulty as the waves and number of players increase. If you participate in the killing of 30 NPCs, and defeat wave 20, you will get a relic of the invading faction, and a chance at other high quality loot. These are dangerous however, and later waves can quickly destroy ships or fleets if you arent strong enough.

NPC "Bosses" will spawn every 5 waves. These enemies typically have 20k+ Health, deal great damage, and are immune to being grappled or dragged, but will also grant rewards to a single participant upon death.

"Funnel" invasions may occasionally be called out, this refers to maps where multiple or all lanes of travel for the invaders come through a single path, making it much easier to defend.

NPCs that are attacking the garrison can be stopped from dealing damage by Hacking them! This can easily save the invasion from chip damage, or make it last that extra bit longer to let you clear them out.

COMBAT STRATEGY
Kiting
Kiting is the most effective way to deal with NPC stacks, but can also be applied to fighting other players. Choose a target and maintain the lock on, but retreat into an open sector away from the target. The goal is that the opponent will chase you into that sector and upon entry will be hit with a large burst of damage from multiple ships targeting and firing at the same time. This strategy works best when using the "Fastest" or "Largest Size" target sorts.

Brawling
Brawling is the laziest way to farm or take a fight, but is less effective than other choices. This simply involves sitting still and punching each other until one participant is dead. I only recommend this method for farming in areas where you can easily out heal the damage from sitting on a typical size NPC stack, and do not recommend it for PVP.

Rotations
Rotations typically use two stacks of players, but can be done with a single stack against non-moving targets such as structures or NPC stacks that refuse to budge. It involves choosing a target, firing all the main guns, then leaving the sector but immediately re-entering the sector. This causes only the first few weapons from each stack to be able to fire. This allows multiple stacks to maintain DPS between weapon cooldowns, or to pick off specific targets before retaliation can occur.

Hooking
Hooking requires ships or items with the "Advanced Grappling III" Technology, allowing you to forcefully drag hooked ships along with you when you move. This typically means a few small and fast ships entering a enemy controlled sector, grappling as many targets as possible, and dragging them away into a more vulnerable position. It is possible to counter this strategy with Technicians and the purging ability, or by having the driver follow suit with the dragged ships. It still remains one of the strongest late game strats.
ARENA
The Arena is where players go to earn skulls, test their might, and generally participate in PVP. To join your ship must have at least 1,000 Gearscore (average of 1,500 required to get full rewards), and have no more than 1 empty item slot not including engines and specials. Ships do not take any durability loss from deaths, and items take minimal damage.
There are skull rewards for all who participate, with bonuses for the winning team, and the players who had the most Kills, Damage, Repair, and Utility done during that match.
There are item rewards for the winning team or top players. These are most often high quality, low rarity random items, but can also create powerful items such as Tech Computers and ship mods.

Arena victory is given to the team with the most kills as well as the players with the most kills from each of the losing teams. This ensures that participation is encouraged, and that even with a bad luck team you can still clutch a victory for yourself.

Arena comes in many flavors, the main difference being standard and hardcore, which is only separated by the ships statuses. Hardcore ships have an item stolen upon death.
Arena is also divided into Standard or Fleet, which determines if you can follow teammate ships. Fleet allows for more coordination and piloting by skilled players to move the whole team.
Teams can range from 2 to 8, or with 1-3 players being per team in the Chaos arena versions.

The Criteria for "Winning" in the Arena are:
Winning Team (By Kills)
Top 25% of non-winning killers
Top non-winning repairs
Top non-winning utility

*you can only claim one of these slots, so a non-winning killer with leave its slot for a non-winning repair, even if it had more than another player*


Popular arena builds include:
Very high hull
Advanced Grappling 3
Novas
Splash/Crit builds
Crux Drives
ARENA (HARDCORE)
Hardcore Arena:
While the same as typical arena matches, all participating ships must be in hardcore mode. This gives them many bonuses, at the cost of losing one random item upon death, which is given to one of the ships attackers or is dropped into the sector if the death was environmental. I would only recommend experienced players with spare ships join into hardcore arenas due to the upkeep cost of constantly regearing ships, for a small amount of skulls.

Popular hardcore arena builds include:
High shield builds
Cloaking
Skip Drives
B Tier items & Ships
SHIP PROGRESSION & BUILDING
Progression:
As you progress you gain the ability to craft and pilot bigger and stronger ships. Ranging from the humble Shuttle to the towering Emperor, and coming in 5 flavors of faction, there is 50 different base ships you can craft, and another 5 from modifications.

The size classes are as follows
Small: Shuttles, Frigates, Assassins
Medium: Cruisers, Destroyers
Large: Battleships, Flagships
Huge: Carriers, Hades
Massive: Emperor

The level requirements for small to large ships are all met at level 25, and can basically be ignored, but Carriers, Hades, and Emperors have more intimidating level requirements. Each faction increases the level requirement by an additional 5 from the previous one.
The order is Human - Pirate - Het - Wyrd - Precursor
Hades start at level 30 for humans, but need level 40 for Het Hades, as an example
Carriers start at level 35 for humans, but need level 50 for Wyrd Carriers
Emperors start at level 45 for humans, but need level 65 for Precursor Emperors.

Each faction has a set of bonus effects and slots depending on said faction
Humans are relatively cheap to build, have the Intuition tech but have 1 less EP than average
Pirates use human materials to build, have the Junker and Grapple Speed techs, and gain item bonuses from ANY faction equipment.
Hets gain an extra drone slot, have the Shield Bypass and Battery Drain Speed techs, and Het Frigates have stronger scans.
Wyrds gain an extra battery slot, have the Shield Capaciters and Hack Speed techs, and Wyrd Assassins have stronger cloaks
Precursors gain an extra weapon slot, have the Shield Amplifier and Targeting techs, and have 1 more EP than average.

Building:
Human and Pirate faction ships will require Human Relics, and humans will require less skulls and Relics to build
Hets will require Het Relics to build
Wyrd will require Wyrd Relics to build
Precs will require Prec Relics to build.

Relic and Skull costs remain the same for most factions for each ship type (Emperors always using 1,000 skulls and 50 relics, for example) but "better" factions will require more resources to build, in the same order as above.

Ship Durability:

*SHIP DURABILITY HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY REMOVED TO ENCOURAGE MORE RISK BY PLAYERS, LEAVING THIS HERE FOR LEGACY PURPOSES*

When ships die they incur a damage penalty. Death in a PVP Enviroment reduces the durability by 0.1%, and deaths in a PVE Enviroment reduces the durability by 0.3%. Arena deaths deal no damage, and invasion deaths count as 0.1%.
The reduction caps out at -35%, and it directly affects that ships Max Hull, Max Shield, Resource Capacity, and all Resistance stats, lowering them by said percentage.
Ships can be repaired for an increasing skull or tech point cost after each one. Starting at 10, and ramping all the way up to 5,000 at the highest.
SHIP ELITES, MODS, STAT MODS, AND SKILLS
Ship Elites:
Each ship can be modified in 3 ways. Elite Rank, Ship Mod, and Stat Mod.
The Elite Rank will add 1 Equip point add skill points, and improve the custom ship technologies on the ship, but at the cost of skulls

Elite 1 Costs 100 Skulls
Elite 2 Costs 500 Skulls (600 Total)
Elite 3 Costs 1000 Skulls (1600 Total)
Elite 4 Costs 2000 Skulls (3600 Total)
Elite 5 Costs 3000 Skulls (6600 Total)

Ship Mods:
Ship Mods consist of rare and powerful modifications that can add more technology to any ship. The strength of the technology is also affected by Elite Ranks! These consist of:

Raider - Adds bonus damage vs players and structures

Freighter - Adds bonus resource storage multiplier and resource harvesting, but reduces damage

Paladin - Adds bonus hull amount and damage vs structure attackers

Medic - Adds the ability to purge negative effects and improves repair action

Phoenix - Adds the ability to revive upon death with a small amount of HP then cloak for a short duration as well as increased healing to very low HP targets. Gained from killing 5,000 Invasion NPCs (+1000 Per each previously earned mod)

Gladiator - Adds always critical against low HP targets in both attacking and healing. Gained from 100 wins in the Arena (+15 Per each previously earned mod)

Ultimate - Adds 4 Equip Points and 1 of each item slot, only one of your deployed ships can have this at a time

Interdictor - (CARRIER ONLY) Replaces the Leadership bonus with the Interdictor Bonus, changing it from a AOE movespeed buff for your allies to a AOE movespeed and targeting debuff to enemies.

Unique - unique ships have permamently attatched mods that give it a random increased amount of EP, item slots, and two random technology effects. These can range from something as simple as "Damage Vs Aliens" up powerful effects such as "Interdictor" and "Leadership"

Ship Stat Mods:
Ship Stat Mods have a large variety of effects, but typically consist of a small but noticeable bonus to a single stat, such as damage, hotbar powers, or resists. These can also be rare +1, +2, or +3 Equip Points.
SHIP LOADOUTS (BUDGET)
***DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT THE ONLY OR THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY TO BUILD OUT YOUR FLEET THIS IS SIMPLY WHAT I WOULD DO AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME***

Battleships:
- Rare+ 0 EP Shield
- +3600 Hull "Fat" Armor
- Elite+ 4 EP Armory
- Cabal Computer
- Any Engine
- Any Special
- Any Batteries
- Any 10 Second or higher cooldown Main Weapon using up as much EP as possible
- Any +1 EP Aux Weapons
- Any BAS/LCD Fighter Drone Main Drone
- BAS-V12 Medic Drones (Free Item)

Alternatively you can go for a shields focused build, putting 10 EP into a Precursor-08 shield and then having at least 3000 hull behind it, will give you a solid amount of free regeneration to help sustain in shorter fights or with PvE content.

This will ensure that you are capable of doing damage and sustaining damage, being able to both safely farm and join corp activities. Your goal should be to get to level 20 and have 4 of these setup.

List of "Fat" Armors:
Carbide
Composite
Cytoplast
Holocrine
Osmium
Citadel
Ajax
SHIP LOADOUTS (MIDGAME & CARRIER)
***DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT THE ONLY OR THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY TO BUILD OUT YOUR FLEET THIS IS SIMPLY WHAT I WOULD DO AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME***

This is the assuming that you are at least level 40 at this point, and have access to at least 6 ship slots

Human Carrier:
- Precursor 08 Shield using any extra avalible EP
- Highest Rank "Fat" Armor you can fit while maintaining -65%
- 0 EP Storage
- Havok Computer/Havok Tech
- Gravity Drive/Speed Engine
- Advanced Propulsion Special
- Voltaic Batteries
- Synchronotron/Accelerator
- DCD-V5 Main Drone
- Any V5 Drones/BAS-V12
- Nanobot Charge Kit (Cheap Consumable upkeep)

You want to have the highest rarity and quality possible on all these items, and hit "-65%" Move Speed and at least 4k Hull
With the addition of void items, other items to look out for include any shields, fat hulls, storages, and normal movement speed engines with a bonus void speed on top. These will vastly increase the available speed or hull speed penalty you can absorb.

Het Hunter Freighter:
- 0EP Het 04/09/10 Shield
- Any +3600 Hull Fat Armor
- 4 EP Armory/Archive Storage (+1 Drone Slot)
- Sage Mark/Sage Tech Computer
- Any Engine
- Prospector
- Resource Capacity Het Main Weapon
- +1 EP Aux Weapons
- DCD-V3 Harvester Main Drone
- Any Harvester Aux Drones
- Resource Capacity Ship Stat Mod
- Freighter Ship Mod

The goal is to get as many drone slots on a prospector/freighter with the highest rarity/lowest cooldown drones you can get while maintaining good hull. I don't reccomend using a hades/car/emp class ship so you can keep this ship when you start hitting higher ship counts, when you are forced to use smaller ship sizes.

Het Frigate Scout:
- 0 EP Het 04/09/10 Shield
- MAX EP Any Fat Hull
- 0 EP Armory Storage
- Victor/Toil Computers/Tech
- Any Engine
- Elite+ Scout Special
- Any Battery
- +1EP Weapons
- BAS-V12 Medic Drones

Building a tanky frigate gives you a consistent source of vision, and between the +1 scan range from being a frigate, and the +2 from an elite scout, you will easily be able to check nearby sectors for targets or enemies.

Any Hades Gunners:
- 0EP Matching Faction 04/09/10 Shields
- Any +3600 Hull Fat Armor
- 4 EP Armory Storage
- Toil/Victor/Cabal Computers/Techs
- Any Engine
- Any DPS Special (Drone Master, Adv Elec, Adv Muni)
- Moltic Main Battery
- Any Aux Batteries
- MAX EP 10+ Second Cooldown Main Weapon
- Any +1 EP Aux Weapons
- BAS-V2/5/9 Fighter Main Drone
- BAS-12 Medic Aux Drones

This setup should give you at least 5k hull to work with and plenty of damage on the first shot to kite and rotate with. You can also adjust the Armor/Weapon EP ratios to become more tanky, but i wouldn't reccomend any less hull size. Also consider having one or two technician specials in your setup for increased healing and status purging.

SHIP LOADOUTS (ENDGAME & INTERDICTOR)
***DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT THE ONLY OR THE ABSOLUTE BEST WAY TO BUILD OUT YOUR FLEET THIS IS SIMPLY WHAT I WOULD DO AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME***

Emperors:
- 0 EP Faction 10 Shield
- +8400 Hull Citadel Armor OR Faction Armor
- 0 EP Prec Armory
- Ice Mark II/Ice Tech I OR Cabal II/Cabal Tech I
- Neutron Drive/Crux Drive
- Advanced Munitions OR Technician Special
- Moltic Main Battery
- Any Ultimate Aux Batteries
- Annulifier OR Dragon Main Weapon
- Quantunneller/Eradicator Aux Weapons
- DCD-V9 Fighter Main Drones
- 0 EP Medic Aux Drones

Between 10k hulls and 20+ EP Size weapons, emperors are the classic gunners for most of the end game options, but keep in mind the largest size ship also means its the slowest.

Interdictor:
- 0 EP Faction 10 Shield
- MAX EP Citadel Armor
- 0 EP Pirate Vault
- Toil/Victor/Havok Computer/Tech
- Stealth Drive
- Deflector OR Technician OR Adv Shields OR Tank Special
- Mecuric OR Polyanic Main Battery
- Any Ultimate Aux Batteries
- Max Hull Het Main Weapon
- Any +1 EP Aux Weapons
- DCD-V4 Main Drone
- Any 0 EP Medic Aux Drones
- 1,600 Skulls for ELITE RANK 3

The Interdictor is easily one of the most important utility ships in lategame, between chasing down most players easier and ignoring most NPC Interdictors, life becomes much easier. It also requires you to reach at least Elite Rank 3 to maximize its use, but is the only ship in my fleet setups that objectively requires that setup. You can also set these up as DPS or grappling ships, but I prefer to make them as defensive as possible.
MONEY MAKING METHODS
There are many ways to make decent cash, but many of them require a baseline of gear, teammates, or specific items. These can also vary depending on daily events.

General Farming:
While not the best method for farming in any case, it is accessible to any and all players. Simply grinding away in a relatively easy zone for both experience and materials is valuable and consistent.

S9 Farming:
S9 systems are difficult, but the NPCs are quite predictable, and with 50+ ships it can easily be farmed with minimal losses as long as ships are not poorly setup. I recommend using Kiting or Hooks to separate out larger stacks into more chewable chunks.

Arena:
The Arena is incredilby consistent, producing at least 7 skulls every 2 hours to any who join and actively participate. The reward scales with the effort as well between earning more skulls in standard, participating in Hardcore, and the rewards that can drop for winning.

Hardcore Arena:
Much less consistent than its counterparts, requiring more investment and risk, but offers greater rewards through higher quality victory rewards as well as stealing items from enemies ships in combat.

Uni Busting:
Universe Busts occur typically right at the start of every loveday, where players will group up to destroy most if not all NPC structures on the server. Each structure drops at LEAST a p

Assassin/Leader Hunting:
With certain daily events, hunting down specific enemies can yield great rewards as long as you have specific or relevant gear. For example during the event "Assassin leaders drop valuable blueprints", as long as you have a strong scout special or high ranking frigate you can easily check through maps and target them.

Roiding:
While not quite efficient as other methods harvesting asteroids can be quite relaxed even in PVP zones as they are typically empty. This is a great source of farming Darkmatter, as well as mutation kits or alien technology during the "leaders in asteroids" and "alien secrets in asteroids" daily events.

Market Flipping:
Many players will come upon good or valuable gear that isn't useful to them anymore and sell it at a discount or even scrap them just to get it out of their inventory. You can often buy these items well below the market value and then list them on the market for a while. This isn't fast by any means, it just requires patience for the item to have the correct buyer.

Spaceball:
The forbidden method is to just gamble. This can either go really well or really bad. A few players have made millions of credits doing this and others have lost it all.
(IF YOU HAVE A GAMBLING ADDICTION PLEASE CONTACT OZYMANDIAS OR MYTHRA, THEY CAN PERMANENTLY LOCK YOUR ABILITY TO JOIN SPACEBALL)

ARTIFACTS
Artifacts:
Artifacts are constantly changing positions, but can be captured and sent to a deployed structure controlled by your corp. This will give you the associated bonus as long as your corp maintains control over it. The artifact will automatically decay after a set amount of time, and will reappear elsewhere in the universe. Artifacts can also be studied, only if uncaptured or captured by a friendly alliance, to gain a bonus +1 player skill point permanently. There are a total of 55 Artifacts, each with its own small bonus.

PARTY BOXES
Party Boxes:
A Party Box is a rare item that gives a buff or activity to your corp or alliance members upon use. These are available in Ultimate, Legendary, Elite, Ultra-Rare, and Rare, and Corp Party or Alliance Party versions. Upon use of a Party Box anyone who gained a benefit from it is unable to loot Party Boxes from the world for the next hour, and the user is unable to use another Party Box for an hour. Upon use the box will be removed from your inventory, have its rarity reduced by 1 rank, and it will re-appear within a few sectors of a player from another alliance for them to loot and use it. Rare boxes are destroyed instead of redistributed. Party Boxes grant either a powerful temporary buff or a task to complete for a high quality, specific rarity reward, which has the possibility of being a powerful Tech Computer or Scientist items like Engines and Specials

List of Box Effects:
Drag Party - Your next X grapple actions are overpowered (Advanced Grappling III)
Lan Party - Your next X hack actions are overpowered (Advanced Hacking III)
Death Party - Your next X critical attacks are overpowered (Maximum Damage ?)
Love Party - Your next X hull repairs are overpowered (Technician IV)
Farm Party - Your next X harvests are overpowered (Harvesting Rank 7?)

VANITY
Current Pictures of Ship Skins:
Note that UNIQUE ships can have any random skin applied to them, even outside of their ship class.


Player Titles come in 4 types:
Steam titles always generate single word titles, such as "Spymaster" or "Legionnaire"
Reward titles always generate two word titles, such as "Wrinkly Warrior" or "Sour Savage"
Custom titles are given out, upon request, by Ozymandias the dev. These are typically one time things due to workload and achievement concerns, and are subject to review. They allow for more creativity and inside jokes.
Achievement titles are rewards for reaching specific milestone. The "Admiral" series of achievements are given out by reaching total amounts of achievements. The "Crafter" series of achievements are given out by reaching total crafting skill in specific types.

Player Portrait:
Player icons each have a random Symbol, Mask, Item, Makeup, Mods, and Armor. You cannot purposely choose these at the moment, but you can randomly reroll them all for 2 Tech Points each time. They also can be changed freely between Male, Female, and the 3 age ranges to activate certain random daily event effects.

TROUBLE SHOOTING
Something not working like you think it should? Check here to make sure it isn't something simple!

Why can't I use Scan/Cloak/Grapple/Drain/Hack despite having the proper ship/item/tech?
Make sure that you have the ship selected or it is nearby the ship you currently have selected. Controls will only pull from the next possible ship when it is close enough, typically within 2 sectors. Your ships may also be hacked and unable to perform most hotbar actions. Being Hacked or lacking enough Battery can also cause these issues.

What are these purple question marks in a sector?
Those are indicators that ships are within the sector, but your vision/scan isnt strong enough to reveal the sector, or defeat their cloak power. You can still reveal these ships with on-move effects such as Ram and Hack Ram, or by coaxing them into attacking you first.

What is this red segmented outline around a sector?
That is the effect of an enemy Interdictor. Staying in that sector will cause you to have reduced movement and targeting speeds. In some cases these are caused by other players, and in PvE zones or invasions will NOT affect you.

My ships keep losing follow/Are running away by themselves!
Solo ships moving away can be caused by Grapple Drags, Ram Throws, or misclicks while having the ship selected. A ship will automatically stop follow if it is more than 2 sectors away from the follow target. Also keep in mind the animation speed of larger and slower ships, if all of your ships are trying to follow the smallest one, the small one will consistently outrun the others, leaving them in the dust!

Someone keeps linking "[?ITEM?]" in chat?
This is indicative of a broken item link. This originally would show a specific item that exists somewhere within the game, but after being vaulted, scraped, or otherwise removed, the link doesn't function anymore.
