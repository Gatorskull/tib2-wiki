    **What are tech points (TP)? What should I spend them on?** Tech Points (TP) are one of the three basic currencies in The Infinite Black 2. You will acquire TP through in-game achievements, completing missions or purchasing them with credits (1,000 credits = 1 TP) or real life money on tib2.com. TP can be purchased with credits, but cannot be sold or traded. They have a few functions:
    
    - **Augmenting items**: increasing an item's rarity. The cost to increase an item's rarity increases with rarity. An uncommon special costs 18 tech points to increase in rarity to rare, a rare costs 36 TP to augment to ultra rare, an ultra rare costs 240 TP to increase to an elite, and so on. In general, only items of at least 230+ quality at uncommon rarity are worth augmenting. To augment an item, click the item and click 'upgrade'.
    - **Ranking up/down items**: some items can be increased or decreased in size, including: weapons, shields, storages, armors. Increasing an item's size will generally increase the item's positive and negative stats. The main reason you will want to increase or decrease an item's size is to maximize the use of your ship's slots. To rank an item, click the item and click 'upgrade' -- it is in the same menu as augment.
    - **Teleporting**: as long as you are not flagged in combat, you may teleport to any NPC garrison that you have 'studied' and any corp/alliance structure, regardless of whether you have visited the corp/alliance structure. Each teleport costs 1 TP. Teleporting can be accessed in the three line 'hamburger' menu in the top left.
    - **Repairs**: there are two ways to repair items. One way is to click 'upgrade' on any item's menu, and hitting repair. However, this first method will reduce the quality of your item. Another way is to use a chat code ':corp repair my tp confirm' which will repair 5 random equipped items by 10% of every online player in the corporation, at an approximate cost of 1.5 tech points per item.

    **Specials and what do they do** Specials are an item slot. Like other items, they are affected by quality and by whether they have 'void' status. Unlike other items, specials cannot have their quality repaired/increased through in-game quality kits. **Specials generally only realize their full potential when ranked to ultimate.** The following is a list of specials in the game, ranked by no particular order:
    
    - **Technician**: probably the best special in the game. An ultimate variant of this allows your repairs to heal 1,200 hull points per click, have a chance to crit for 2,400 hull points of heal, plus splash up to four other ships with heal, and also apply a repair-over-time status to any ship affected by its heal. Ships affected by repair-over-time are immune to all status effects for approximately 10 seconds, except for advanced hack 3, which disables abilities.
    - **Prospector:** the perfect farming special. Normally, harvesting an asteroid or debris grants 1 resource per # size of an asteriod. A roid listed as 12/12 will loot up to 12 resources. A prospector gives a chance to create bonus resources, potentially causing that 12/12 rock to yield 40 resources or more. Pair it with harvesters for max goodness.
    - **Advanced Munitions**: the best special to make your gun do more damage. It adds critical damage, raw damage, splash chance. Pair it with a high crit ship.
    - **Scout**: The special that gives you a little bit of speed, and the power to see what is around you. Ultimate scout specials can decloak any ship.
    - **Stalker**: The opposite of a scout. This special makes you invisible for a short amount of time and can be useful as a method to escape when being targeted or chased. You can only be decloaked if you are scanned by a more powerful scanner, if the cloak timer runs out, or if you fire your weapon.
    - **Advanced Propulsion:** the special to make you move fast. Most commonly found on carriers.
    
4. Continued:
    
    - **Alien Technology:** the most basic of specials. Add +1 EP, not much else. Generally only used by those under lv 10. Otherwise, its usefulness is for deconstruction, to create new special blueprints.
    - **Alien Hunter:** a special that helps you generate more loot when killing NPCs. This special affects the loot rate modifier, meaning more resources, more frequent and better drops, and is stackable. In general, the loot rate modifier is maxed in the presence of an ulimate alien hunter, or a combination of lower rarity alien hunters.
    - **Hacker**: Hacker special ranked to ultimate allows you to use hack to disable an enemy ship's abilities roughly once every 35 seconds. An ultimate hack can remove a technician's repair-over-time and stop a crux drive from functioning.
    - **Grappling Hook**: a hook ranked to ultimate allows you to 'drag' an enemy with you into the next sector. It is an effective PVP item used commonly in medium or smaller ships. The drag ability only works at ultimate rarity.
    - **Nova Device**: a device that makes it so, when your ship dies, you explode after a short delay, damaging all non-friendly ships around you. Nova can be disabled via advanced hack.
    - **Deflector**: most commonly used in structures, gives a % chance to deflect the damage shot at you into damage onto the person shooting at you.
    - **Vampire**: drains shields and batteries. Nothing special happens at ultimate. This special is not really used.
    - **Battle Ram:** one of the best specials for a new player. Creates % chance of a ram, causing large damage, when moving. Ram kills do not reward XP, but rams can be used to lower the health of an NPC ship significantly, allowing you to finish it in a few shots for full XP.
    
5. - **Advanced Electronics:** a combat special that adds resistances and critical chance. It is a lesser used special as it offers no competitive advantages at ultimate rarity.
    - **Advanced Construct:** a support special that increases EP, hull points and other soft stats, while granting immunity to ram type attacks.
    - **Drone Master**: Increases damage and heals done by drones, and reduces ship target speed. Not commonly used.
    - **Advanced Shields:** Increases shields by a percentage in addition to a stat bonus, plus increases to other defensive resist stats.
    - **Tank**: Decreases damage output in exchange for increased hull and taunt ability, which forces an enemy ship to target you. Damage output debuff can be nearly negated at 256 void ultimate.
    
6. **Joining PVP -- fleet vs fleet** Fleet versus fleet PVP often happens spontaneously, or when fleet commanders call for players to stage in alliance chat. Typically, a call will consist of a commander/leader (highlighted chat) posting a link to a structure, and a link to a ship. Your job when joining is to ensure you follow a few rules that will help ensure a good experience for everyone on your team. 1) **Turn on your sector ship counts.** There is a maximum of 75 allied ships permitted in a single sector, any higher and every ship in the fleet will lose HP until enough ships die to get back to under 75. Do not be the player to make the stack exceed 75. To turn on sector ship counts, visit the three line menu (top left) > settings > gameplay > gameplay settings > display local sector ship counts. Make sure this is checked off in green. 2) **Set assist lead on up to three drivers.** Fleet vs fleet only happens with drivers. These are the ships being linked in alliance chat when a call for PVP is issued. Typically, drivers will list themselves by number: D1, D2, D3, to represent drivers 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Click each ship link, and to the right, click 'my assist leader'. This will highlight the ship on the map in a yellow square, and also bring the ship on top of any stack of ships you are present in, allowing you to easily follow this ship or find it on the map. 3) **Follow sort orders** During PVP, there is a lot going on and the primary method most players communicate by, including commanders issuing orders, is alliance chat. Pay attention to sort calls. Common sort calls can include:
    
    - small hulls
    - fastest movement
    - largest size
    - most in danger
    - worst gear
    
    ... and so on. Selecting the sort that is called ensures that the order you see enemy ships in is the same order your alliance mates see them. It helps us all shoot the same target. To select your sort, click the three line menu (top left) > sort enemy > click the called sort.
    
7. **How do I make sure my ships are geared for PVP?** Fleet PVP is not the same as arena PVP, but there are ways to adjust your gear to ensure you get skulls and stay alive to do so. First, ensure you have at least 10,000 hull. The most common sort is "smallest hull" and newer players tend to get targeted first, and eliminiated quickly. By having a sufficient hull point pool, you can mitigate this. The next most important stat is targeting speed. As long as you are able to hit an enemy before it dies, you will receive skulls for the kill. There are times when you target an enemy ship, and the ship dies before you can fire a shot. This mean you won't get skulls for the kill. The solution for this is targeting speed, which can be adjusted by items such as moltic batteries, graviton/matter reverter/helical railgun, arsenal storages, and drone master specials, or through void items with a ^ modifier for targeting speed. The max targeting speed bonus is 65%, reaching this or exceeding it (up to 95% to neutralize enemy interdictor debuffs) will help you achieve kills faster and earn more skulls.

    Ultimate rarity items are guaranteed to drop based on the amount of NPCs that you kill. If you kill 3000 SR8 difdicukty NPCs you will get an Ultimate item. SR9 difficulty drops at a faster rate of 2800 NPCs. Lower SR difficulty NPCs drop at a lower rate with SR7 NPCs causing one to drop at 3300 NPCs killed.

    Missions There are Captain (Individual), Corporation, Alliance, and Universe Missions available. (And also Outpost missions, which are covered in a different section). All missions can include the following types: Kill x Aliens (ie. Kill 70 aliens level 80+, Kill 70 Hets, Kill 40 Elite Carrier-class aliens, Kill 35 Precursor Shuttles) Harvest x Resources (ie. Harvest 300 Crew, Harvest 120 Darkmatter) Collect x Enemy Skulls For kill alien missions, pirates count as aliens. For kill elite missions, killing an elite npc will give credit equal to the elite rank of the npc, ie. killing a ADV npc will progress the quest 5. For collect skulls missions, each kill only contributes 1 skull regardless of how many skulls are actually earned (ie. if 5 buddies and I work together to kill an enemy ship and each earn 1 skull, that only progresses the quest 1). The following missions are available for specific types: Captain: Explore x System y sectors - This goes in order from lowest to highest security rating, and only appears for maps that you have not finished exploring Corporation/Alliance/Universe: Destroy x npc structures (ie. Kill 3 alien garrisons, Kill 3 pirate structures) All missions give a base 250xp and 5 tech points upon completion. During the daily event 'Mission rewards doubled', this is doubled to 500xp and 10 tech points. Captain missions are done individually. Corporation missions are shared with your corp, alliance missions are shared with your alliance, and universe missions are shared with all players in the server. When a corporation/alliance/universe mission is completed, any player that contributed at least 1 progress to the mission will get the full rewards. When a corporation/alliance mission is completed, any corp with a player that contributed at least 1 progress will get double the rewards to the corp (ie. 500xp and 10 tech points base).

    Mission Strategies All missions (except explore x system) can appear multiple times and seem to be random. Multiple overlapping captain missions can progress at the same time, ie. killing a level 80 pirate flagship will progress both 'Kill 80 aliens' and 'Kill 40 flagships' if the player has both those missions active. Since players can have up to 3 concurrent captain missions, it may be useful to have multiple of the same type and progress them together. Multiple overlapping alliance missions cannot be progressed at the same time. If the alliance has the missions 'kill x pirate assassins' and 'kill y assassins', killing a pirate assassin will only progress the most recently acquired mission, not both. It is useful to have multiple alliance missions in the same area, ie. Kill 5000 precursor shuttles and Kill 4000 precursor frigates, but it is not useful to have multiple of the same alliance mission. Only 1 corporation and universe mission can be active at a time. Missions can be cancelled by opening the mission panel and pressing the red x on the right. The game will replace it with a new random mission during the next minute interval. Players can get up to 4 new missions per day, whether from cancelling them manually or completing them and getting a new one automatically. If a player has already gotten 4 new missions for the day, they will not be allowed to cancel current missions. Corporation/Alliance missions can only be cancelled by commander or leader ranked players. Universe missions cannot be cancelled. Corporation/Universe missions are only refreshed once per day (ie. if you complete 2 corporation missions in the same day, you won't get a new one until the next day). Each corporation in an alliance gets their own alliance mission once per day, so if you have 6 corps you can see up to 6 new alliance missions in a day. If a non-captain mission has not gained any progress in 3 days, it will be automatically cancelled.

    Subjective Mission Strategies For captain missions: Leave 1 sector unexplored in each new map, and then wait for the explore x system mission to appear before you finish exploring it to get the bonus rewards for the mission. If you don't play a lot, aggressively refresh missions that you don't want to do or are too specific (ie. kill 35 precursor emperors). Since you get 4 new missions per day, it's good to cancel that many missions if you weren't going to complete them all anyways, and you can get easier missions like kill 80 aliens. For corporation missions: Aggressively refreshing missions may not be the best thing to do, since you can only get a new one once a day. Still, replace missions that are extremely specific. If your corporation is full of new players, it's best not to have a mission that requires killing aliens level 50+. For alliance missions: Always refresh missions that overlap with other active missions, unless at least one can be completed within a day. Again, try to keep missions that are generic like kill x aliens or kill y pirates, and avoid missions that are specific and will take a long time like kill z pirate assassins level 50+. For universe missions: You can't control these. Make sure to get participation credit and then let it complete naturally. In an active corporation/alliance, getting a single npc kill for participation credit on both of your characters can be an easy source of extra tech points.
