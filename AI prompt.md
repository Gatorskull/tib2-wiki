**Project Summary: The Infinite Black 2 Wiki**

**The Goal** I am the project lead for the unofficial community wiki for the space MMO _The Infinite Black 2_. My goal is to maintain a professional, high-quality, and ad-free knowledge base using a "Docs-as-Code" approach, allowing for strict data control and easy collaboration for my team of 3.

**The Tech Stack**

- **Engine:** MkDocs (using the "Material" theme).
    
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Public Repository).
    
- **Editor:** Obsidian (Local Markdown editing).
    
- **Version Control:** GitHub Desktop (Git).
    
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions (Auto-builds the site on push).
    

**The Workflow**

1. **Pull:** Contributors fetch updates via GitHub Desktop.
    
2. **Write:** Content is written locally in Obsidian within the `docs/` folder.
    
    - _Structure:_ We use folders for categories (e.g., `docs/Ships/`).
        
    - _Navigation:_ We use `index.md` files inside folders to create section landing pages.
        
    - _Assets:_ Images are stored in `docs/assets/`.
        
3. **Push:** Contributors commit changes with tagged summaries (e.g., `[Content]`) and push to `main`.
    
4. **Deploy:** The site automatically updates live within 60 seconds.
    

**Current Configuration**

- **Theme:** Slate (Dark Mode) with Deep Purple/Cyan accents.
    
- **Features:** Instant navigation, Admonitions (Info/Danger boxes), and Collapsible Spoilers are enabled.
    
- **Domain:** Currently hosted on `github.io`, with plans to migrate to a custom domain (CNAME configuration required).
    

**Immediate Needs** I need assistance with [Insert your next task here, e.g., "designing a template for Ship Stats" or "fixing a broken table"].
