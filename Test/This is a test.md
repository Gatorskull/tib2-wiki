Every 48 hours, a shuttle departs the earth and does things such as observing how the moon is way too close to the earth, and the sun is nowhere to be seen. There are no other planets in the solar system. 

The shuttle takes notes using its shuttle hands and shuttle notepad, and puts the notepad in its shuttlepocket. 

It looks around.

There is a new player. Oh wait. It's an alt. Oh wait. It's a plane. Oh wait. It's just Mythra.
