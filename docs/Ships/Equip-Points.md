# Equip Points

**Equip Points** are the capacity your ship (or defense structure) has for mounting weapons, armor, shields, batteries, drones, and other equipment. **Larger ships have more Equip Points.**

The sum of all equipped items' costs cannot exceed the ship's maximum. Item rank and rarity affect how many points each piece uses.
