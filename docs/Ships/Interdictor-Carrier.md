# Interdictor Carrier

The **Interdictor** is a [**Ship Mod**](Ship-Mods.md) that is **crafted** from your captain’s Item Crafting panel. It allows a **Carrier-class** ship to become an **Interdictor**, permanently **replacing** the Carrier’s Leadership bonus with a sector-wide penalty to enemies.

[**Gravity Drives**](../Items/Gravity-Drives.md) negate the Interdictor’s movement penalties for ships that have them equipped.

---

## What the Interdictor Does

- **Sector penalty** — The Interdictor projects an effect in **nearby sectors** that:
  - **Increases** enemy **targeting** and **movement** times by **up to 30%** (strength grows with the Carrier’s [**Elite Rank**](Elite-Ranks.md)).
  - **Removes** other movement benefits such as **Space Lanes**.
- **One per sector** — Only **one** Interdictor can have influence in a given sector. It is assigned to the **first to arrive** or the **most powerful** Interdictor (by tech rank). Any other Interdictors that enter later (or with lower tech) **suffer the penalty** like every other enemy — they do not stack or share control.
- **No effect in The Arena** — The Interdictor effect does **not** work in [**The Arena**](../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/Arena.md).

## Crafting

- Interdictor is **crafted** like the [Ultimate](Ship-Mods.md) ship mod.
- Requires **identical fragments and Relics all from the same faction**.
- The **final crafted item** is the same regardless of faction; only the source materials must match.
