# Hardcore Ships & Defense Units

Any **ship** or **defense unit** can be set to **Hardcore** (opt-in). Hardcore units gain strong bonuses but **drop equipment** and lose more **durability** on death. [**Corporate Defender**](../Entities/Corporations/Corporate-Defenders.md) ships are never chosen from Hardcore ships — only non-Hardcore eligible ships can be used as Corp Defenders.

---

## Hardcore Bonuses

When a ship or defense unit is Hardcore:

- **−10% Movement Cooldown** — Faster sector-to-sector movement.
- **+25 [Skill Points](../Gameplay/Skills.md)** — Extra skill points to spend.
- **+3 [Equip Points](Equip-Points.md)** — Ships gain 3 more EP. **Corporate defense units** gain **+10 Equip Points** when Hardcore.
- **+5 additional Skill Points** — Hardcore units can invest 5 more skill points (on top of the +25), for greater build flexibility.

---

## Hardcore Penalties and Rules

- **Drop on death** — When a Hardcore unit dies, it drops **1 random equipped item**.
- **No free newbie gear** — Hardcore units **cannot** equip free starter/newbie gear.
- **Durability** — Hardcore units lose **slightly more** durability on death than non-Hardcore.

So Hardcore is high risk, high reward: better stats and EP, but death costs you an item and more durability.

---

## Corporate Defenders and Phoenix

- **Corp Defenders** — [Corporate Defender Ships](../Entities/Corporations/Corporate-Defenders.md) are drawn from corp/alliance members’ ships. **Hardcore ships are never used** as Corp Defenders; only eligible non-Hardcore ships are considered.
- **Phoenix Ship Mod** — Ships with the [Phoenix](Ship-Mods.md) mod **cannot** go Hardcore, and Hardcore ships cannot use the Phoenix mod.

---

## Oblivion Server

On the [**Oblivion Server**](../Gameplay/Oblivion-Server.md), rules are harsher:

- **Hardcore ships** lose **100% durability** on death and **drop all equipped items**.
- Hardcore ships that get the killing shot generate [**pity loot**](../Items/Pity-Loot.md) at **2×** the Oblivion accelerated rate, stacking with other loot bonuses (e.g. up to 10× or more during invasions).
