# Deception Module

The **Deception Module** is a ship upgrade that **hides** information from other players — such as equipped gear, [**Equip Points**](Equip-Points.md) used, and various [**stats**](/Items/Stats.md). It does **not** replace or conflict with [**Ship Mods**](Ship-Mods.md) and works on **any ship**. You can toggle deception on or off from the **Ship Inspect** panel.

Deception effects **grow stronger with [Elite Rank](Elite-Ranks.md)**: higher rank hides more slots and item types.

## What Is Hidden (by Elite Rank)

More is hidden as the ship’s Elite Rank increases. The following lists show what is **hidden at or above** each rank.

### Hidden at Elite Rank 0

- Gear Score
- Cloak / Scan Power
- Advanced Stats & Resists
- Equip Points Used
- Weapon, Drone and Battery Slot 6
- Storage Item

### Hidden at Elite Rank 1

- Weapon, Drone and Battery Slot 5
- Shield Item

### Hidden at Elite Rank 2

- Weapon, Drone and Battery Slot 4
- Armor Item

### Hidden at Elite Rank 3

- Weapon, Drone and Battery Slot 3
- Computer Item

### Hidden at Elite Rank 4

- Weapon, Drone and Battery Slot 2
- Special Item

### Hidden at Elite Rank 5

- Weapon, Drone and Battery Slot 1
- Engine Item

So at **Elite Rank 5** with Deception on, other players cannot see your gear score, resists, equip points used, or any of your six weapon/drone/battery slots, storage, shield, armor, computer, special, or engine.
