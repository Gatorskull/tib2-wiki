# Elite Ranks

Ships and [**defense units**](/Entities/Structures/index.md) can be upgraded with **Elite Ranks** using [**Skulls**](/Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md) (earned from PvP). Each rank adds [**technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md), [**skill points**](/Gameplay/Skills.md), and/or [**Equip Points**](Equip-Points.md). Use the **ELITE RANK** button on the Unit Inspect Panel; you can **preview** improvements without confirming.

## Ship Elite Rank Costs (Skulls)

| 1 | 100 |
| 2 | 500 |
| 3 | 1,000 |
| 4 | 2,000 |
| 5 | 3,000 |

**Defense unit** Elite Rank costs are **5×** the ship costs.
