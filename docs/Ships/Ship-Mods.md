# Ship Mods

**Ship Mods** are consumable items that **permanently** modify a [ship](index.md). There are **8** of them. Once applied, the ship gains new bonuses and [**technologies**](../Gameplay/Technology.md) that can be improved further through [**Elite Ranks**](Elite-Ranks.md). To preview how a ship would change, use the mod on a ship but **cancel** the final confirmation popup.

Except for **Interdictor** (Carrier-only), ship mods can be applied to **any ship**. Although they are effectively permanent, they can be **reclaimed** with [**Tech Points**](../Entities/Currencies/Tech Points.md) from the ship’s detail panel.

## The 8 Ship Mods

| Mod | Effect | Main source / notes |
|-----|--------|----------------------|
| **Medic** | Adds Repair Speed and [**Technician**](../Gameplay/Abilities/Technician.md) technology. | Various; pairs with repair builds. |
| **Gladiator** | Adds Vorpal and Savior technology. **Guarantees** critical attacks vs injured enemies and critical repairs on injured friends. | **The Arena**: earn a Gladiator mod and titles for every **100 victories**. |
| **Phoenix** | Adds Rebirth and Savior technology. Converts **fatal damage** into a large repair and instant cloak; improves repairs on injured friends. Rebirth works in PvP and PvE with **separate cooldowns**. | **Invasion NPCs**: kill invasion enemies to earn Phoenix mod and titles. **Cannot** be used on [Hardcore](Hardcore-Units.md) ships; ships with Phoenix cannot go Hardcore. |
| **Raider** | Adds bonus damage vs **Players** and **Defense Units**. | Various. |
| **Interdictor** | Converts a **Carrier** into an Interdictor; replaces Leadership with sector penalty to enemies. Only **one** Interdictor can have effect per sector. | **Crafted** (fragments + Relics, same faction). See [Interdictor Carrier](Interdictor-Carrier.md). |
| **Freighter** | Adds large **resource harvesting** bonuses but **reduces damage**. | Various; e.g. daily event “Ancient Alien Secrets” — Freighter mod **doubles** harvesting chances. |
| **Paladin** | Adds max hull and defensive technology. | **Crafted**: created **only** when any **Emperor-class** ship is [crafted](Ship-Crafting.md) as an additional bonus result. |
| **Ultimate** | Adds **+4 [Equip Points](Equip-Points.md)** and unlocks additional gear slots. | **Crafted** from “fragments” dropped by [NPC defense units](../Entities/Structures/index.md) or harvested from [Relic Shrines](../Entities/Currencies/Relics.md). You may only have **one deployed Ultimate ship** at any time. |

## Crafting Ultimate and Interdictor

- Both **Ultimate** and **Interdictor** ship mods are **crafted**.
- Crafting requires **identical fragments and Relics all from the same faction**.
- There is **no difference** in the final crafted mod between factions — only the source of materials must match.

## Deception Module (Separate Upgrade)

The [**Deception Module**](Deception-Module.md) is a **separate** ship upgrade that hides equipped gear, resists, and other [stats](../Items/Stats.md) from other players. It **does not replace or conflict** with any of the 8 ship mods above and works on any ship.
