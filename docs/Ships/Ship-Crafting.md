# Ship Crafting

[**Corporations**](/Entities/Corporations/index.md) level up their [**Shipyards**](/Entities/Structures/Shipyards.md) to unlock ship blueprints. Members build ships at the corp's shipyard; each Shipyard is dedicated to **one faction** (Pirate, Het, Wyrd, or Precursor). Corp leadership chooses the faction, opening advanced **alien-class** ships with different [**technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md) — more powerful but more expensive.

## Requirements

* [**Larger ships**](Size-And-Targeting.md) have more [**Equip Points**](Equip-Points.md), allowing stronger items.
* **Advanced ships** require [**Skulls**](/Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md) and [**Relics**](/Entities/Currencies/Relics.md) in addition to basic resources.
* You need a corporation with the **right faction shipyard** to build that faction's ships.

## Ship Stat Bonus Mod

When you craft a ship it gains a **random Ship Stat Bonus Mod**. Its strength is comparable to a number of [**Skill Points**](/Gameplay/Skills.md):

* **Random roll:** Between **3** and **12** Skill Points equivalent.
* **Maximum (12)** is only possible during rare **daily crafting events**.
* **Ship Stat Modification** items can drop as loot, letting you **replace** this crafted bonus.

## Corporation Ship Crafting Skill

Building a ship increases your **corporation's ship crafting skill** for that faction (e.g. building a Wyrd Reaper increases Wyrd Ship Crafting Skill). Corporations can earn up to **1,000** ship crafting skill points **per day**. Higher corp ship crafting skill **improves** the Ship Stat Bonus Mod on newly built ships.

## Equip Point Bonus

There is a **1% chance** a crafted ship gains **+1 Equip Point**; rarely **+2** or **+3**.
