# Ships

Your fleet is the heart of *The Infinite Black 2*. You command multiple ships, each with its own equipment, level, and role. Combat is balanced around **multiple ships** — new players should explore 100% of Sol to earn a second ship and join a [**Corporation**](../Entities/Corporations/index.md) for [**ship construction**](Ship-Crafting.md) and tech.

## Ship Classes

There are **10 ship types** in TIB2:

| Size | Classes |
|------|---------|
| **Small** | Shuttle, Frigate, Assassin |
| **Medium** | Cruiser, Destroyer |
| **Large** | Battleship, Flagship |
| **Huge** | Carrier, Hades |
| **Massive** | Emperor |

Each of the **5 factions** (Human, Wyrd, Het, Precursor, Pirate) has its own variant of each class — **50 different ships** in total. [**Ship size**](Size-And-Targeting.md) controls movement speed, targeting speed, [**Equip Points**](Equip-Points.md), and more.

## Fleet Size Requirements

Your fleet must contain a **mix of ship sizes** to deploy more slots:

| Fleet size | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| 8 ships | MEDIUM or smaller |
| 9 ships | SMALL + MEDIUM or smaller |
| 10 ships | SMALL + MEDIUM + LARGE or smaller |

Smaller ships satisfy larger requirements (e.g. a MEDIUM counts as your LARGE slot). See [**Small Strike Team Bonus**](../Gameplay/Abilities/Small-Strike-Team-Bonus.md) for the benefit of fielding small/medium ships.

## Captain Level to Deploy More Ships

| Ships | Captain level |
|:-----:|:--------------:|
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 10 |
| 4 | 20 |
| 5 | 30 |
| 6 | 40 |
| 7 | 50 |
| 8 | 75 |
| 9 | 100 |
| 10 | 150 |

## Starting Ship

Players begin in a **Striker Gunboat** with better-than-average ability and decent gear. Striker Gunboats gain more equipment slots and Equip Points with [**Elite Ranks**](Elite-Ranks.md). You can own **100+ ships** of any type and deploy several at once.
