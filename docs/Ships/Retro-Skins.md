# Retro Ship Skins

**Retro Ship Skins** are one-time-use [**items**](../Items/index.md) that change the visual model of a [ship](index.md) to an alternate “retro” style. Every ship **class** has **2 or 3** alternate models that can be discovered or awarded. Skins can be traded or sold. Once used, the skin is consumed and that ship keeps the new look.

A visual reference for skins is available at: [https://files.spellbook.com/tib/retroshipskins.jpg](https://files.spellbook.com/tib/retroshipskins.jpg)
