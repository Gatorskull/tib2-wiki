# Ship and Defense Unit Size

Every combat entity has a **size**: Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Massive. Size affects movement speed, evasion, and **weapon targeting speed**. See the [Ships](index.md) page for fleet size and captain level requirements.

## Targeting

Before weapons can fire, a **target lock** must be acquired. **The greater the size difference**, the longer it takes for a large ship to lock onto a small one. Big ships are meant to fight other bigs and have trouble targeting shuttles and frigates.

* **Small ships** — Can't carry as much, but are **much more evasive**. Use small ships to target other small ships and leave big guns for big targets.
* [**Defense units**](/Entities/Structures/index.md) (Planets, Garrisons, etc.) — **No targeting limit**; they target nearly instantly. Very slow weapons on defenses get an attack speed bonus.
* [**Fighter drones**](/Items/index.md) — **Ignore size disparity**, so Carriers are strong against small targets.

## Movement Warm-Up

Ship size sets **pre-move "warm up"** time (the pre-jump animation):

| Size | Warm-up |
|------|---------|
| Small | 0.7 s |
| Medium | 1.0 s |
| Large | 1.3 s |
| Huge / Massive | 1.7 s |

The **Skip Drive Engine** and **Gravity Drives** (crafted engine) reduce this to **0.5 s** for any ship.
