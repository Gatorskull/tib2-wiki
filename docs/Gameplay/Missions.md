# Missions

Each captain can have up to **three personal missions** at a time. In addition, every [**Corporation**](../Entities/Corporations/index.md) has a shared **Corp Mission** and every [**Alliance**](../Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md) has an **Alliance Mission**. Everyone in the game also works together on one **Universal Mission**.

## Mission Limits & Deletion

* You can **delete up to 3 missions per day** to get new ones (resets at 00:00 UTC with [daily reset](../World/Maps/index.md)).
* **Corp missions** are progressed by **all corp members**.
* **Alliance missions** are progressed by **all alliance members**.
* You **must participate** in shared missions to get a reward.
* **Leaving your corp** resets your shared mission participation (you lose progress toward corp/alliance mission rewards).

Corporations can **cancel** their corp or alliance missions using the **:CORP** and **:ALLIANCE** chat commands.

## Important Rules

* **"Aliens" in missions** — Means **any NPC enemy**, including Pirates. Mission text that says "Aliens" can include Pirates unless specified otherwise.
* **Corporate Defenders** — [**Corporate Defender**](../Entities/Corporations/Corporate-Defenders.md) kills do **not** count for mission kill credit.
