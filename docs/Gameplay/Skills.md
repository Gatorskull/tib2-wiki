# Skills

**Captains**, [**Ships**](/Ships/index.md), [**Corporations**](/Entities/Corporations/index.md), and defense structures each have a **Skill Tree**. Points invested give permanent stat improvements — and **all of these stack** (captain + corp + ship).

New skill points come from leveling and from studying Artifacts (captured at corp [planets](/Entities/Structures/Planets.md) and garrisons). Skills can be invested up to 10 points per stat, with reduced benefit above 5 (so spreading points is often wise).
