!!! warning "Availability"
    Spaceball may not be available in some countries or on some app platforms.

## Basics

- **Table** — There are **38 numbers**: 1 through 36, plus **0** and **00**.
- **Colors** — Numbers 1–36 alternate **RED** or **BLACK**. **0** and **00** are **GREEN**.
- **Roll** — The Spaceball rolls **every minute** to select a number.
- **Bets** — You can place bets any time before the roll. Bets continue even if you close the chat window.

## Placing Bets

1. Click a number or betting field on the table.
2. Choose how many **Credits** or **Tech Points** to bet.
3. **Winning bets** — Payout is given immediately on the roll; your bet is returned with the payout.
4. **Losing bets** — The bet is removed from the table.
5. You can click a bet at any time to **take it back**.

**Repeat Bet** — In the bet dialog you can set a "Repeat Bet" count. If the bet loses, the same bet is re-placed automatically (even if you close the chat window).

## Bet Types

- **Straight-Up Bet** — Bet on a single number. **Best payout** (35 to 1) but **riskiest**.
- **Dozen bets** — 1st Dozen (1–12), 2nd Dozen (13–24), 3rd Dozen (25–36): **2 to 1**.
- **RED or BLACK** — **1 to 1**. Good for beginners.
- **EVEN or ODD** — **1 to 1**.
- **LOW (1–18) or HIGH (19–36)** — **1 to 1**.

RED/BLACK and EVEN/ODD are safer and best for beginners.
