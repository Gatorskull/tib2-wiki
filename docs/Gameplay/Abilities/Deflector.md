# Deflector Technology

**Deflector** gives a **chance to negate all incoming damage** and **return it to the attacker**. The negated amount is **100%** (not random). The deflect roll happens **after** Hit/Evasion and Critical, in the final damage step. Deflector can trigger on **any** damage (weapons, drones, splash, battle ram).

**Deflected damage** is treated as an attack: it benefits from the defender's [stats](/Items/Stats.md) such as Outgoing Damage Bonus, Shield Pierce, etc.

[**Advanced Hacking III**](Hacking.md) can disable a target's Special Item abilities, including **Deflector**.
