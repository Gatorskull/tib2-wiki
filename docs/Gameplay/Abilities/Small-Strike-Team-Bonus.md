# Small Strike Team Bonus

When a fleet of **4 or more** [ships](/Ships/index.md) has **at least 33% Small or Medium** ships, the fleet gets the **Small Strike Team** bonus:

* **+5% Outgoing Damage** for the **entire fleet**
* **+5 to all resists** for the **entire fleet**

The bonus applies to **all** ships in the fleet, not only the small/medium ones. It encourages mixed fleet composition and squad tactics instead of stacking only large ships.
