# Drain Ability

With **10+ Drain Chance** a [ship](/Ships/index.md) can use the **Drain** hotbar action. **No battery cost** to activate. Drain **steals** some of the target's **shields and battery**, making weapons and other abilities harder or impossible to use.

## How It Works (No Dice Roll)

* **Drain Chance** — Increases **amount** taken.
* **Drain Resist** — Reduces amount. 1 point Drain Resist ≈ 2 points Drain Chance (1% for NPCs). ~20 Resist for a chance to fully resist vs +10 Drain Chance. Below 3 Battery damage: **50% resist**. Below 1: **always resisted**.
* **Evasion** (players): 5 Evasion = 1 Drain Resist.
* **Hit Chance** (players): 5 Hit Chance = 1 Drain Chance.

## Base Amount

5 Battery + 2 (Advanced Draining) + 4 (Advanced Draining II). Each **Drain Chance** +1% amount; each **Drain Resist** −2% (or −1% NPCs).

## Reverse Drain

**Reverse Drain** — 50% chance to reflect the Drain at the attacker using the target's Drain Chance (even if &lt;10).
