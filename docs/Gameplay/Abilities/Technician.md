# Technician Technology

[**Ships**](../../Ships/index.md) can improve **repair** ability with the **Technician** line from the **Technician [Special item](../../Items/index.md)** or the **Medic [ship mod](../../Ships/Ship-Mods.md)**. Higher **rarity** on the Technician Special and higher **Elite Rank** on a Medic ship add more ranks.

## Ranks

| Rank | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **1** | Remove negative status effects — **Purge** button on friendly ships with a negative effect (8 s cooldown). Normal repairs do **not** remove negative effects. |
| **2** | Repairs can **critical** (use ship's Critical Chance). |
| **3** | Repairs can **splash** to nearby ships (use ship's Splash Chance). |
| **4** | **Repair-over-time (ROT)** — 21 s, +50% hull from the repair that triggered it. Target **cannot be grappled, hacked, or taunted** during ROT; one of the strongest counter-strategies. First pulse removes existing negative effects. |

Repair **drones** with Technician can remove negative effects but **cannot** splash or apply repair-over-time.

## Counters

**Technician** can **remove [Taunt](Taunt.md)** and apply ROT, protecting the victim for 21 seconds. [**Advanced Hacking III**](Hacking.md) can **purge** ROT and hack the target.
