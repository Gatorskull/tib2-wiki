# Abilities

Hotbar abilities and special technologies that shape combat: **Grapple**, **Hack**, **Drain**, **Technician** (repairs), **Taunt** (tank), **Deflector**, and **Junker**. Many use the same stat vs resist pattern (Chance increases effect, Resist reduces it; Evasion and Hit Chance factor in for players).

## Hotbar Abilities

Require **10+** of the matching stat to use. Battery cost except Drain.

| Ability | Stat | Effect | See |

| **Grapple** | Grapple Chance | Target loses 25 Evasion, cannot move. 25% battery. | [Grapple](Grapple.md) |
| **Hack** | Hack Chance | Target can't use hotbar (except Repair), no battery regen, no special movement. 25% battery. | [Hacking](Hacking.md) |
| **Drain** | Drain Chance | Steals shields and battery; no battery cost to use. | [Drain](Drain.md) |
