# Taunt (Tank)

The **Tank** [Special item](/Items/index.md) gains **Taunt** at **Ultra-Rare rarity and above**: it **forces damaged enemies to attack the tank**. The target change happens automatically on any **HIT or CRITICAL** from the tank (not on SPLASH or other damage types; it can splash during some daily events). Duration depends on the Tank item's **rarity and quality**.

The forced target change also triggers a new **target lock** cooldown for the victim, as with any target change.

## Counter

[**Technician**](Technician.md) technology can **remove Taunt** and apply a Repair-Over-Time effect that protects the victim from negative effects for **21 seconds**.
