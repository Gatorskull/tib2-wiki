# Grapple Ability

With **10+ Grapple Chance** a [ship](../../Ships/index.md) can use the **Grapple** hotbar action. It **consumes 25% battery**. Grappled targets **lose 25 Evasion** and **cannot move**.

## How It Works (No Dice Roll)

* **Grapple Chance** — Increases **duration** of the effect.
* **Grapple Resist** — Reduces duration. **1 point Grapple Resist ≈ 2 points Grapple Chance** (or 1% for NPCs). ~25 Resist gives a chance to fully resist vs +10 Grapple Chance. Below 2.5 s duration: **50% resist**. Below 1 s: **always resisted**.
* **Evasion** (players): 5 Evasion = 1 Grapple Resist.
* **Hit Chance** (players): 5 Hit Chance = 1 Grapple Chance.

## Base Duration

* **Base:** 4 s + 1 s (Advanced Grappling) + 2 s (Advanced Grappling II).
* Each point of **Grapple Chance** adds **1%** duration. Each point of **Grapple Resist** reduces duration by **2%** (1% for NPCs).

## Reverse and Advanced

* **Reverse Grappling** — 50% chance to reflect the Grapple back at the attacker, using the target's Grapple Chance (even if &lt;10).
* **Advanced Grappling III** — Grappler can **drag the target to another sector** when moving. From the Grappling Hook special item and **Elite Rank 3+ Cruiser**.
