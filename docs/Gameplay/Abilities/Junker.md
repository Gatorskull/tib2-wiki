# Junker Technology

**Junker** can trigger a **hull repair to the attacker** whenever they deal damage (including drones, splash, battle ram). The attacker is repaired for **33% to 100%** of the total hull damage dealt. It **does not trigger** if total damage is **less than 30**.

Junker **does not** benefit from other tech (e.g. Technician) or the +Hull Repair [stat](/Items/Stats.md).
