# Hacking Ability

With **10+ Hack Chance** a [ship](../../Ships/index.md) can use the **Hack** hotbar action. It **consumes 25% battery**. Hacked targets:

* **Cannot use** any hotbar ability **except Repair**
* **Battery does not regenerate**
* **Special movement** (engines, Space Lanes) does not work

## How It Works (No Dice Roll)

* **Hack Chance** — Increases **duration**.
* **Hack Resist** — Reduces duration. 1 point Hack Resist ≈ 2 points Hack Chance (1% for NPCs). ~25 Resist for a chance to fully resist vs +10 Hack Chance. Below 2.5 s: **50% resist**. Below 1 s: **always resisted**.
* **Evasion** (players): 5 Evasion = 1 Hack Resist.
* **Hit Chance** (players): 5 Hit Chance = 1 Hack Chance.

## Base Duration

4 s + 1 s (Advanced Hacking) + 2 s (Advanced Hacking II). Each **Hack Chance** +1% duration; each **Hack Resist** −2% (or −1% NPCs).

## Reverse and Advanced III

* **Reverse Hacking** — 50% chance to reflect hack at attacker using target's Hack Chance (even if &lt;10).
* **Advanced Hacking III** — Disables target's **Special Item** abilities (e.g. Nova, Deflector). **Purges** the [Technician](Technician.md) Repair-Over-Time immunity and applies a hack.
