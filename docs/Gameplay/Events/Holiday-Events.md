# Holiday Events

On **specific calendar days**, special **gem** holiday events run. During these events, certain NPCs drop **rare and powerful items**.

## Event Dates

| Date | Holiday |
|------|---------|
| January 1st | New Year |
| March 17th | St. Patrick's Day |
| June 19th | Juneteenth |
| July 4th | Independence Day |
| October 31st | Halloween |

## How It Works

* **Gem NPCs** — Special NPCs have a **glowing gem** floating over their [ship](../../Ships/index.md). **Kill them** to collect the drop.
* **Spawn** — Gems can spawn **anywhere** at any [Security Rating](../../World/Maps/Security Rating.md), but **often in harder areas**.
* **Clues** — Every **30 minutes**, a clue about where to find gems is **whispered to one player**. Sometimes a whole [**corporation**](../../Entities/Corporations/index.md) or even the **entire universe** is told.
* **Visibility** — Gems are **not visible for 30 minutes** (even to the player who got the clue), giving captains time to reach the spot before others.
