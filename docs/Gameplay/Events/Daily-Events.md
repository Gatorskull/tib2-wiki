# Daily Events

There is a **daily event reset every 24 hours**. Most timed mechanics reset at **00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**, including:

* Leveling [**defense units**](/Entities/Structures/index.md)
* New [**missions**](/Gameplay/Missions.md)
* [**Free Daily Gifts**](Free-Daily-Gifts.md)

## Random Daily Events

**Over 50 random Daily Events** can modify core game rules, for example:

* Granting [**small ships**](/Ships/index.md) powerful **temporary** abilities
* Adding bonus [**stats**](/Items/Stats.md) to any [**crafting**](/Ships/Ship-Crafting.md) that day (ships or items)

You get an **alert when logging in** with the current daily events, or type **:DAILY** in chat at any time.

## Love Day and War Day

**Intergalactic Love Day** and **War Day** alternate with each daily reset:

* **Love Day** — Open-world [**PvP**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/index.md) is **disabled**. All players can cooperate.
* **War Day** — Open-world PvP is **enabled**.

## "Aliens" in Events and Missions

In daily events and missions, **"Aliens"** means **Wyrd, Precursor, and Hets** — **not** Pirates. Missions that say "Aliens" **can** include Pirates depending on the mission text.

## Example: Ancient Alien Secrets Hidden In Asteroids

When this event is active:

* Only **real asteroids** count (Rock, Radioactive, Ice, Darkmatter).
* **Less risk = less reward** — better results in PvP maps.
* Primary way [**Special Items**](/Items/index.md) enter the game (via deconstruct and blueprints).
* Bonuses that increase resources harvested improve chances.
* [**Freighter**](/Ships/Ship-Mods.md) ship mod **doubles** harvesting chances.
* Drone Master special reduces harvesting cooldown.

## Secret Unlocks

Some events require **secret unlocks** involving your **portrait** or **selected title**, e.g.:

* Naked Aggression
* Young is Brash - Old is Wise - Admirals are Critical
* Space Karen Demands Resources
