# Party Boxes

**Party Boxes** are items that grant your [**corporation**](../../Entities/Corporations/index.md) or [**alliance**](../../Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md) a **temporary activity or combat bonus**. They mainly come from [**Reward Point Gifts**](Reward-Point-Gifts.md) and are thrown to a **random sector** when used. Players who receive a party **cannot loot another party box for 1 hour**.

**Captain Panel → REWARDS → My Party Bonus** to see your active buffs and activities. They **expire after 21 days**.
