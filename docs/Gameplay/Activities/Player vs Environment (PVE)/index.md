# Player vs Environment (PvE)

**PvE** is everything you do against the world and NPCs rather than other players: fighting pirates and aliens, harvesting, [**missions**](../../Missions.md), and events like [**Invasions**](Invasions.md). In **human-controlled (PvE) maps** you are safe from player attack — they appear **blue** on the [Starmap](../../../World/Maps/index.md).

## What Counts as PvE

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **NPC combat** | Killing normal, elite, and leader NPCs; clearing [**NPC defense units**](../../../Entities/Structures/index.md). |
| **Harvesting** | Asteroids (Rock, Radioactive, Ice, Darkmatter) and resources. |
| [**Missions**](../../Missions.md) | Personal, corp, and alliance mission objectives (many are PvE). |
| [**Invasions**](Invasions.md) | Timed PvE events; defeat invasion NPCs and bosses for rewards. |
| **Exploring** | Unlocking systems, finding jump gates, and discovering the [Starmap](../../../World/Maps/index.md). |

## Safe Space vs PvP Space

* **PvE maps (blue)** — Human-controlled; **no player attacks**. Ideal for leveling, missions, and farming when you don’t want PvP risk.
* **PvP maps** — Other factions; [**PvP is possible**](../../Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/index.md). Higher risk, but better [pity loot](../../../Items/Pity-Loot.md), more XP, and [Relics](../../../Entities/Currencies/Relics.md) from shrines.

Daily events like **Intergalactic Love Day** turn off open-world PvP so everyone can focus on PvE; **War Day** turns it back on (reset at 00:00 UTC).

## Rewards

* [**Pity loot**](../../../Items/Pity-Loot.md) — Progresses with NPC kills; higher [Security Rating](../../../World/Maps/Security Rating.md) = better progress and tiers.
* **XP and resources** — From kills, harvesting, and mission completion.
* **Event loot** — Invasions, holiday events, and free daily gifts offer unique rewards (e.g. [Phoenix ship mod](../../../Ships/Ship-Mods.md), [Void items](../../../Items/index.md)).

!!! info "Daily reset"
    Most timed PvE mechanics (new missions, free daily gifts, defense unit leveling) reset at **00:00 UTC**.
