# Invasions

**Invasions** are PvE events where NPC forces attack and players work together to defeat them. Winning an invasion and killing invasion NPCs (including bosses) gives strong rewards.

## Rewards

| Reward | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Victory loot** | Invasion victory loot has a **1:20 chance** to be [**Void**](../../../Items/index.md). |
| **Phoenix Ship Mod** | You can earn the [**Phoenix ship mod**](../../../Ships/Ship-Mods.md) and titles by **killing Invasion NPCs**. Phoenix gives Rebirth (fatal damage → repair + cloak) and improved repairs on injured allies. |
| **Party Box activities** | [Party Box](../../../index.md) activities can include **"Invasion Victory"** — complete the task for bonus loot (e.g. 1 in 25 chance of an advanced Tech Computer). |

## Pity Loot Note

Invasion boss loot and other non-standard invasion drops **do not reset** your [pity loot](../../../Items/Pity-Loot.md) counters. Your normal pity progress is unchanged.

## Hardcore & Oblivion

On the Oblivion server, [Hardcore](../../../Ships/index.md) ships can get **up to a 10× loot bonus** (or more during invasions) when they get the killing shot, stacking with other bonuses.
