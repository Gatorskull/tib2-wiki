# The Arena

**The Arena** is the best place to earn [**Skulls**](/Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md). It's a **controlled** PvP environment: balanced teams, no Artifacts or [Corporation Skills](/Gameplay/Skills.md), so matches are fair and predictable.

## How It Works

* **Schedule** — Rounds run **every few hours at the top of the hour**. Registration opens before each round.
* **Access** — **Captain Panel → ARENA** when registration is announced.
* **Objective** — The team with the **most kills** wins. Captains who lose but have high kill counts still get **bonus rewards**.
* **No durability loss** — Your ships don't lose durability on death in The Arena. Gear loses only **1% durability**, and only **half the time**.

## Requirements

| Player type | Requirement |
|-------------|-------------|
| **New players** | At least **1 ship** with [**Gear Score**](/Items/index.md) **1,000+** and **no free starting gear**. |
| **Advanced** | Some arena types require **more than 1 ship**. |

Check the in-game Arena screen for the exact requirements of each upcoming round.

## Why Arena?

* **Skulls** — Primary way to earn Skulls without open-world structure warfare.
* **Safe** — No open-world risk; no ship durability loss.
* **Balanced** — No artifact or corp skill advantages; gear and skill matter.
* **Rewards** — Winners and high-kill participants get rewards (Skulls, items, etc.).
