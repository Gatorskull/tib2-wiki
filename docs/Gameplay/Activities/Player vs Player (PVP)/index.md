# Player vs Player (PvP)

PvP is where you earn [**Skulls**](../../../Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md), fight for territory, and help your [**alliance**](../../../Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md) capture [**Relic Shrines**](../../../Entities/Currencies/Relics.md). Human-controlled space is safe; everywhere else you can be attacked — or attack.

## Where You're Safe (PvE Maps)

You are **safe from attack** in **human-controlled systems**, called **PvE Maps**, marked in **BLUE** on the [**Starmap**](../../../World/Maps/index.md).

When you join a [**Corporation**](../../../Entities/Corporations/index.md) you also join their **alliance**. In PvP maps you're on a team with everyone in that alliance. Friendly ships share vision, can follow or repair each other, and attack enemies to split XP and loot.

## Why PvP? Rewards

* **~10% more XP** and **~20% more loot** when hunting in PvP maps (vs safe space).
* [**Pity loot**](../../../Items/Pity-Loot.md) progresses faster in dangerous areas.
* [**Skulls**](../../../Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md) — from killing players and from **defending or attacking** non-NPC [**defense units**](../../../Entities/Structures/index.md). Structure warfare is one of the best ways to earn Skulls.
* **Relics** — Most PvP maps have a **Shrine**. Corps place a [**Garrison**](../../../Entities/Structures/Garrisons.md) on the shrine to capture the map and generate [**Relics**](../../../Entities/Currencies/Relics.md) for the alliance.

## Where You're (Mostly) Safe in PvP

* **At your corp's defense units** — You're relatively safe until that structure comes under attack.
* **At Jump Gates** — Safe only if you're **not flagged in combat**.

!!! danger "Never 100% safe"
    **You are never 100% safe in PvP maps.** Even at your own structures, an attack can start at any time.

## Collision (Stacking Limit)

A **Collision** mechanic limits how many ships can be in one sector to reduce lag. Collision (damage over time) triggers when:

| Condition | Limit |
|-----------|--------|
| Total ships in sector | More than 225 |
| Ships per alliance in sector | More than 75 |
| Enemies attacking a defense unit | More than 75 (any alliance) |

## Love Day (No Open-World PvP)

**Intergalactic Love Day** is a daily event that **disables open-world PvP**. On Love Days everyone can work together. It alternates with **War Day** (PvP on) at each daily reset (00:00 UTC).
