## Hardcore Ships on Oblivion

[**Hardcore**](../Ships/Hardcore-Units.md) ships generate [**pity loot**](../Items/Pity-Loot.md) at **2×** the Oblivion accelerated rate when they get the killing shot. This stacks with other bonuses — **up to 10×** or more during invasions.

## Arena on Oblivion

* **Hardcore ships** — Drop **one** item on death (not everything).
* **Normal ships** — Do **not** drop any equipment on death.
* **Equipment** — Takes **1%** durability damage on death.
* **Ship durability** — **1%** loss on death.
* **Rewards** — The Arena **can award Ultimate** items.

## Tech Points and Reward Points

* [**Tech Point**](../Entities/Currencies/Tech Points.md) **orders** deliver to **both** Primary and Oblivion if you have a character on each. There is **no link** between servers; **nothing transfers**.
* [**Reward Point Gifts**](./Events/Reward-Point-Gifts.md) can buy [**Party Boxes**](./Events/Party-Boxes.md) that include **Ultimate** rarity on Oblivion.
