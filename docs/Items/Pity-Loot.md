# Pity Loot Drops

Most item drops use the **Pity Loot System**: every NPC kill adds to a counter until you get a drop. For example, after **7–8 kills** you're effectively "guaranteed" an **Uncommon**; after **33–40**, a **Rare**; around **300** kills, **Ultra-Rare**, and so on. NPCs can also **drop loot at any time** — when that happens, your pity counter for that rarity **resets**.

## Risk and Reward

Pity counters **progress faster in more dangerous areas**. You won't see much progress toward Ultra-Rare until around [**Security Rating 3**](../World/Maps/Security Rating.md), and you need to go further for Elite, Legendary, and Ultimate drops.

**Quality** of loot depends on the **level** of what dropped it, even for pity drops. Kill higher-level NPCs for better quality gear.

## PvP and High-Security Bonuses

* [**PvP maps**](../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/index.md) progress pity **faster** and can produce a **guaranteed rare [Relic](../Entities/Currencies/Relics.md)** crafting component.
* **Security Rating 8** maps get a **25% loot boost**.
* **Security Rating 9 Homeworld** raids get **double** pity loot.

## What Does NOT Reset Pity

These do **not** reset your pity counters:

* Stealing items
* Invasion boss loot
* Killing [NPC defense units](../Entities/Structures/index.md)
* [Party Boxes](../Gameplay/Events/Party-Boxes.md) and other non-standard loot sources
