# Mutate Item Kit

**Mutate Item Kits** are [**crafted**](Item-Crafting.md) consumable items used on a single piece of equipment. Using a kit **mutates** that item, adding a random stat bonus. Each item can **only be mutated once** in its lifetime; the mutation is permanent and the bonus is always positive.

Mutate bonuses behave like and **stack with** [**Void Item**](Void-Items.md) bonuses.

## How Mutate Kits Work

1. **Craft** a Mutate Item Kit from your Captain Panel (Item Crafting). The kit targets a **specific [item type](index.md)** (Weapon, Armor, Shield, etc.); that type is **randomly selected when the kit is crafted**.
2. **Use** the kit on a piece of equipment of the matching type. The kit is **consumed**.
3. The target item gains a **random mutation**: one stat is improved by an amount determined by a **rarity roll** (see table below).
4. That item may **never** be mutated again. If you want a different mutation on the same item, you must use a **Re-Mutate Item Kit** (see below).

Mutate also **increases the scrap and deconstruct value** of the item by **50%**.

## Mutation Rarity Chances

When you use a Mutate Item Kit, the **strength** of the mutation is rolled at random:

| Rarity | Chance |
|--------|--------|
| Basic | 32% |
| Uncommon | 30% |
| Rare | 20% |
| Ultra-Rare | 10% |
| Elite | 5% |
| Legendary | 2% |
| Ultimate | 1% |

Each tier of mutation strength is roughly equal to **0.5 [Skill Points](../Gameplay/Skills.md)** of benefit. So an **Ultimate** mutation is like adding about **3.5 extra Skill Points** to your ship for that stat.

The **stat** that is improved is **random** — you do not choose which stat gets the bonus.

## Equip Point Mutations (Very Rare)

There is a **very rare** chance that the mutation will be an **Equip Point** mutation, adding **+1**, **+2**, or **+3 [Equip Points](../Ships/Equip-Points.md)** to the item. These are especially valuable because they increase how much gear you can fit on a ship.

## Re-Mutate Item Kit

If you already mutated an item and want to try for a better result:

- **Re-Mutate Item Kit** — Available from [**Reward Point Gifts**](../Gameplay/Events/Reward-Point-Gifts.md) (3,000 Reward Points).
- Using it on a **previously mutated** item **re-rolls** the mutation.
- Re-Mutate is **guaranteed to improve** the mutation rarity (e.g. Rare → higher tier). The **stat** chosen is still random.

So: first mutation = craft and use a normal Mutate Item Kit; later improvements = Re-Mutate Item Kit from Reward Points.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Source** | [Item Crafting](Item-Crafting.md); kit type random at craft |
| **Use** | One-time per item; consumed on use |
| **Effect** | Random stat bonus (or rare +EP); always positive |
| **Value** | ~0.5 Skill Points per tier; Ultimate ≈ 3.5 Skill Points |
| **Re-roll** | Re-Mutate Item Kit (Reward Point Gifts, 3,000 RP) — improves rarity, random stat |
| **Other** | +50% scrap/deconstruct value; stacks with Void bonuses |
