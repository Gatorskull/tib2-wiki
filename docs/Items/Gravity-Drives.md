# Gravity Drives

**Gravity Drives** are a [**crafted**](Item-Crafting.md) [**engine**](index.md) type with a unique **"Instant Jump"** ability. They give each move a **chance** to be free — the ship arrives in the next sector with **no movement cooldown**. They also **negate movement penalties** such as those from the [**Interdictor Carrier**](/Ships/Interdictor-Carrier.md).

## What Gravity Drives Do

1. **Instant Jump chance** — On each sector move, there is a chance the jump is **instant**: no movement cooldown in the destination sector. This makes travel faster and more unpredictable for enemies.
2. **Negate Interdictor** — [Interdictor Carriers](/Ships/Interdictor-Carrier.md) slow enemy movement and increase targeting time in their sector. Gravity Drive **negates** these penalties for the wearer, so ships with Gravity Drives can move and fight more normally in Interdictor-affected space.
3. **Fleet following** — When a ship with a Gravity Drive is **leading** a fleet, any **following** ship that also has a Gravity Drive equipped will **trigger its own instant moves**. So Gravity Drive fleets can move together and all benefit from instant jumps when they roll.

## Leadership (Carriers) and Gravity Drives

Ships with the **Leadership** ability (e.g. [**Carriers**](/Ships/index.md)) use special rules when leading a fleet:

- They can **quick-jump** every ship following them **with or without** Gravity Drives.
- Their quick-jump speed is **slower** than the "instant" Gravity Drive jump.
- So: for the **fastest** fleet movement, leading with a ship that has a Gravity Drive (and followers with Gravity Drives) gives the best results; Carriers still help move the whole fleet but at a different pace.
