# Item Crafting

**Captain Panel → ITEM CRAFTING** — Blueprints and resources live here. To craft an [item](index.md), collect the resources for a blueprint and click the blueprint. You **discover new blueprints** when you **Research** an item instead of scrapping it.

!!! tip "New players"
    Crafting is expensive and often supported by a [**corporation**](../Entities/Corporations/index.md). Generally, scrap items for [Credits](../Entities/Currencies/Credits.md) unless you're committed to becoming a crafter.

## Quality

Each craft gives **crafting skill**. Skill improves the **quality** of crafted items:

* **Quality range:** 1 to 255.
* **Each point:** +0.1% to the item's [stats](Stats.md) → **25.4%** difference between worst and best of the same rarity.
* Outside [The Arena](../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/Arena.md), loot with quality above 100 is rare. Skilled crafters produce the strongest gear after a lot of effort.

## Skill Categories

There are **6** item crafting skill categories:

| Category | Builds |
|----------|--------|
| **Scientist** | Engines and Special-type items. |
| **Engineer** | Computers, Batteries, Storage. |
| **Weapons** | Weapons. |
| **Armor** | Armor. |
| **Shields** | Shields. |
| **Drones** | Drones. |

Most **Engine** and **Special-type** items enter the game only through crafting or unique events.

## Long-Term Goal

Item crafting is meant to be a **years-long** goal. Few players reach Masterwork level; their items command a premium. All crafted items are **tagged** with the creator's name.

## Commands

* **Queue** — Click a blueprint multiple times to queue several crafts.
* **:CRAFT** in chat — Management commands (e.g. clear queue, set lower skill rank for next craft).
* **:CRAFTVOID** — Used by crafters for [Void](Void-Items.md) crafting.
