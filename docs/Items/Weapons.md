# Weapons

**Weapons** are one of the nine [**item types**](index.md) in *The Infinite Black 2*. They are the primary source of damage for ships and [defense units](../Entities/Structures/index.md). Weapons, along with Armor, Shields, and Storage, have a **Rank** that modifies their power and [**Equip Point**](../Ships/Equip-Points.md) cost; you can change rank (and other stats) via the **UPGRADE** button on the item inspect panel.

## How Weapons Work

- **Damage** — Weapon damage is modified by [**stats**](Stats.md) such as **Outgoing Damage Bonus**, which affects all damage (weapons, drones, battle ram, etc.). See [Stats](Stats.md) for the full list.
- **Targeting** — Before a weapon can fire, the ship must **acquire a target lock**. [**Ship size**](../Ships/Size-And-Targeting.md) affects targeting speed: large ships target small ships more slowly. [**Targeting Speed**](Stats.md) stat modifies lock-on speed.
- **Battery** — Most weapons consume **battery** to fire; [Battery](index.md) and [Engine](./index.md) items affect capacity and recharge.
- **Defense units** — Weapons (and fighter drones) on [structures](../Entities/Structures/index.md) attack **faster** than their listed speed; **slower weapons get a bigger bonus**. Defenses also ignore size-based targeting limits and target nearly instantly.

## Weapon Slots and Fleet

Ships have multiple **weapon slots**. [**Elite Ranks**](../Ships/Elite-Ranks.md) on the Striker Gunboat add more slots (e.g. Elite Rank 3 adds +1 Weapon Slot, Elite Rank 4 adds another). Equip Points limit how many high-rank weapons you can fit; see [Equip Points](../Ships/Equip-Points.md) and [Stats](Stats.md).

## Related Item Types

- **Fighter Drones** — Behave like weapons that don’t consume battery; they **ignore** [size disparity](../Ships/Size-And-Targeting.md), so Carriers are effective vs small targets.
- **Armor / Shield** — Defensive items; see [Stats](Stats.md) for Hull, Shield, and resist stats.
- **Item Crafting** — One of the six crafting categories is **Weapons**; see [Item Crafting](Item-Crafting.md).
