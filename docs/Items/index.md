# Items

Ships and structures equip **items** to gain stats, weapons, and abilities. Loot drops, crafting, and rewards all provide gear.

## Item Types

There are **9 equipment types** in TIB2:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Weapon | Damage output |
| Armor | Hull and defense |
| Shield | Shield capacity and resists |
| Battery | Power capacity and recharge |
| Storage | Resource capacity |
| Drone | Fighter, Medic, or Harvester |
| Engine | Movement and special movement |
| Computer | Targeting and utility |
| Special | Unique abilities (e.g. Technician, Tank) |

**Gear Score** is the sum of your equipped items' scores (based on rarity, quality, rank). Many activities (e.g. [**The Arena**](../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/Arena.md)) require a minimum Gear Score.
