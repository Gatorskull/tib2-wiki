# Void Items

**Void items** are a rare, powerful variant of regular equipment. Each has an **extra stat bonus** (similar to mutated items) that **grows stronger** as you upgrade the item's rarity. Void gear also gains **more [stats](Stats.md)** from item quality, making it better than equivalent non-Void gear.

## How to Get Void Items

| Source | Chance / Notes |
|--------|------------------|
| **Crafted items** | **1:50** chance to be Void. Crafters use **:CRAFTVOID** in chat. |
| **NPC defense units** | Can drop Void loot. |
| **Free Weekly Gift** | [Party Box](/Gameplay/Events/Party-Boxes.md) missions (Captain Panel → REWARDS → CLAIM WEEKLY GIFT). |
| **Standard Arena** | Prizes **1:20** chance to be Void. |
| **Hardcore Arena** | Prizes **1:4** chance to be Void. |
| **Invasion victory** | Loot **1:20** chance to be Void. |
| **Normal loot** | **1:5000** chance. |

## Upgrading Void Gear

Void items can be **mutated** and **upgraded** like normal gear. To upgrade to the **highest rarities** (Elite, Mythic, Omega) they cost [**Relics**](/Entities/Currencies/Relics.md). The Relic's **faction** must match the item's faction:

| Rarity | Relics |
|--------|--------|
| Elite | 1 |
| Mythic | 2 |
| Omega | 3 |

## Re-Void and Conversion

* **Re-Void Kits** — From [Reward Point Gifts](/Gameplay/Events/Reward-Point-Gifts.md). Let you **re-roll** the Void bonus randomly.
* **Void Upgrade Kit** — Crafted (Captain Panel → Item Crafting). Converts a **normal** non-Void item to Void.
