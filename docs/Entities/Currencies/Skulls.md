# Skulls

**Skulls** are the elite currency of *The Infinite Black 2*. They are a mark of combat proficiency and are **fully tradable**, making them highly valuable on the market.

## How to Obtain

Skulls are exclusively earned through Player-vs-Player (PvP) activities:

* **Open World PvP:** Destroying enemy player ships in non-safe sectors.
* **Structure Warfare:** Destroying enemy player-owned structures (POS).
* **The Arena:** Earned as a reward for competing in Arena matches.

## Market Value

Because Skulls are hard to farm but necessary for high-end crafting, they command a high price.

* **Current Value:** ~700 - 800 Credits per Skull.

## Uses

While they can be traded for wealth, Skulls are physically consumed as a material for high-tier manufacturing:

* **Ship Crafting:** Required to craft certain ships. *insert ship crafting cost table link here*
* **Elite Ranks:** Required to increase the elite rank of structures and ships. *insert elite rank cost table link here*
