# Skulls

**Skulls** are a currency and crafting resource awarded to Captains **only from Player-vs-Player (PvP)** activity. They are **tradable** and used throughout the game for high-end progression.

## How to Obtain

### The Arena (best place to earn Skulls)

The best place to earn Skulls is [**The Arena**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/Arena.md): a controlled PvP environment with balanced teams and no Artifacts or Corporation Skills. Rounds run every few hours; open to any captain.

* **Minimum:** One [**ship**](/Ships/index.md) with [**Gear Score**](/Items/index.md) of **1,000** and no free starting gear. Some arenas require more than one ship.
* **Winning:** The team with the most kills wins. High kill counts can give bonus rewards even if your team loses.
* **No durability loss** on death in The Arena; gear loses only 1% durability, and only half the time.

Access via **Captain Panel → ARENA** when registration is open. Arena starts every few hours at the top of the hour.

### Open-world PvP and structure warfare

* **Open-world PvP** — Destroying enemy player ships in non-safe sectors.
* **Structure warfare** — **Bonus Skulls** are awarded for **defending** or **attacking** non-NPC [**defense units**](/Entities/Structures/index.md). Join a [**Corporation**](/Entities/Corporations/index.md) and get involved in the [**Alliance Wars**](/Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md) to earn more.

## Market Value

Skulls are hard to farm but needed for crafting and Elite Ranks, so they command a high price. Typical range: **~700–800 Credits per Skull** (varies with the Auction House). They can be traded for wealth or consumed for progression.
