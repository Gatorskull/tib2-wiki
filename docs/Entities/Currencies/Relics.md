# Relics

**Relics** are a rare [**ship crafting**](/Ships/Ship-Crafting.md) component used to build **Assassin, Hades, Carrier, and Emperor-class** [ships](/Ships/index.md). Each alien faction has its own relic type for building that faction’s ships at [**Corporation Shipyards**](/Entities/Structures/Shipyards.md).

Relics are **tradable** like other resources — they can be sold, traded, or used yourself.

## How to Obtain

| Source | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| [**Alliance Wars**](/Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md) | Main source. Corps capture **Relic Shrines** with [Garrisons](/Entities/Structures/Garrisons.md); shrines generate relics. |
| **Level rewards** | Every 5 levels starting at **Level 15**. |
| [**The Arena**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/Arena.md) | Arena rewards can include relics. |
| **Loot** | Dropped by NPCs. |
| **Free Daily Gifts / Holiday Events** | Special events and daily rewards. |

### Relic Shrines (Alliance Wars)

* Each corporation may control **4 Relic Shrines**; max **10 shrines total** per [alliance](/Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md).
* Captured shrines generate **one relic at 100% progress**. Time per 1% progress:

| Shrine size | Minutes per 1% |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Massive | 78 |
| Huge | 86 |
| Large | 95 |
| Other | 104 |

### Alliance Points (relic distribution)

Each player has an **Alliance Point** counter that increases with kills, PvP, defense fights, Arena, and other alliance glory. **Players with the most Alliance Points get priority** when alliance relic loot is distributed. When someone receives a relic, their counter **resets** so others get a chance.

**Captain Panel → STATS** to see your current Alliance Points.

## Using Relics
