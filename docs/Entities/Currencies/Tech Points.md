# Tech Points

**Tech Points (TP)** are the primary utility and progression currency. They are the most versatile currency in the game, used for everything from item upgrades to guild management.

**Tradability:** Tech Points are **Bound** and cannot be traded between players.

!!! tip "New Player Strategy"
    Don't spend Tech Points augmenting item rarities early on. You will earn a large amount of them from early game achievements which will slow down as you play longer. It is best practice to save them up and use them on an item that you use long term. Your in-game [**corporation**](corporations.md) can help you decide on the best items.
