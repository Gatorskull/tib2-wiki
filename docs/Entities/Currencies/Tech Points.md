# Tech Points

**Tech Points** are the main utility and progression currency. They are used for corps, item upgrades, bank space, travel, and more. You earn thousands over your career and can convert **1,000 [Credits](Credits.md) into 1 Tech Point** at any time.

**Tradability:** Tech Points are **bound** — they cannot be traded between players.

## How to Obtain

* **Conversion** — 1,000 Credits = 1 Tech Point (any time).
* **Gameplay** — Rewards from [Missions](../../Gameplay/Missions.md), outpost missions, and achievements.
* **Store** — Purchasable at [Spellbook.com](https://www.spellbook.com/purchase/tib2/techpoints.php) to support the game. Purchases also grant **Reward Points** — open **Captain Panel → REWARDS** for bonus gifts (Party Boxes, skins, etc.).

!!! info "Oblivion Server"
    Tech Point **orders** deliver to both the **Primary Server** and **Oblivion Server** if you have a character on each. There is no link between servers and nothing transfers between them.

## Uses: Equipment & Items

* **Item upgrades** — Rank items up or down; upgrade [rarity](../../Items/index.md) (e.g. Rare → Ultra-Rare) via the item inspect panel.
* **Research** — Buy research time for technologies in the captain research menu.

## Uses: Player Convenience

* **Bank & garage** — Unlock additional **Item Bank** and **Ship Garage** slots.
* **Quick Jump** — Spend Tech Points to Quick Jump to discovered locations (e.g. alliance structures, human jump gates). Cost is **1 Tech Point per jump** regardless of how many ships move.

## Uses: Corporations

* **Structures** — Unlock new [**defense units**](../Structures/index.md) and pay to **deploy** them (Corporation Management panel).
* **Member slots** — Buy additional corp member slots.
* **Corp bank** — Purchase extra corp bank slots for shared storage.
* **Creating a corporation** — Tech Points are required to found a corp.

!!! tip "New player strategy"
    Don’t spend Tech Points on item rarity upgrades early. You earn a lot from early achievements; that flow slows later. Save them for items you’ll use long term. Your [**corporation**](../Corporations/index.md) can help you decide.
