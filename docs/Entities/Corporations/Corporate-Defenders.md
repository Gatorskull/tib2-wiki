# Corporate Defender Ships

[**Ships**](../../Ships/index.md) owned by members of a [**corporation**](index.md) can be **summoned** while the player is offline to help protect [**defense units**](../Structures/index.md) under attack. These **Corporate Defenders** are deployed automatically and fight under the game's AI. If the ship's owner **logs in**, their defender ships **recall**.

## Benefits

* **No penalty for dying** — Corp Defenders killed during an attack do **not** lose durability or suffer other penalties.
* **Shared pool** — [**Alliances**](Alliances.md) share one pool of Corp Defenders. Any eligible ship in the alliance can be called to fight at **any** defense unit in the alliance.
* **Auto deployment** — The strongest available defenders deploy first, with a mix of small and large units.

## Eligibility

A ship can be used as a Corporate Defender only if it meets **all** of:

| Requirement | Value |
|-------------|--------|
| **Level** | 10 or higher |
| **Weapon** | Must have a weapon equipped |
| [**Gear Score**](../../Items/index.md) | 1,000 or higher |
