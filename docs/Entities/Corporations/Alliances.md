# Alliances

Several [**corporations**](index.md) can join together as a **single team**, forming an **alliance** that captures territory and [**Relics**](../Currencies/index.md) in a never-ending galactic war.

## What Alliances Share

* **Chat room** — One alliance-wide chat.
* [**Missions**](../../Gameplay/Missions.md) — Shared alliance missions (progress and rewards).
* [**Corporate Defenders**](Corporate-Defenders.md) — The alliance shares one pool of defender ships; any eligible ship in the alliance can be called to any defense unit under attack.

## PvP and Friends

All players in an alliance are **friendly** in [**PvP systems**](../../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/index.md) — you don't attack each other in open-world PvP. This does **not** apply in [**The Arena**](../../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/Arena.md), where matchmaking is separate.

## Alliance Citizens

**Alliance Citizens** are players who:

* Are **Level 25+** in a corporation in the alliance, and  
* Have **logged in within the last 15 days**.

### Limits

| | Primary server | Universe #2 |
|--|----------------|-------------|
| **Max corporations per alliance** | 6 | 6 |
| **Max Alliance Citizens (total)** | 180 | 100 |

Corporations **cannot invite** new players once the alliance citizen count is **maxed**. They can always invite players **under Level 25** (they don't count until they hit 25). Players who haven't logged in for 15 days **do not count** toward the cap.

### Primary Alliance Citizen

Each player has a single **Primary Alliance Citizen** character — their **highest-level character**. This is used for mechanics that depend on “one main per alliance,” e.g. capturing **Security Rating 8** maps (citizen requirements).

## Management

* Click the **STATS** button on the **Corp Panel** to view alliance and citizen details.
* Corporations can **transfer Corp [Tech Points](../Currencies/Tech Points.md)** to other corporations in the alliance. Use **:ALLIANCE** in chat for details.
* **Alliance Leaders** (Commanders of the primary corporation) see **Invite** and **Kick** buttons on other corps' panels. Member corporations see a **Leave Alliance** button.

!!! warning "When someone joins or leaves"
    All players in the alliance are **stunned for 30 seconds** when a corp joins or leaves. **Changes cannot be made while defense units are under attack.**
