# Corporations

Corporations are the **social backbone** of The Infinite Black 2. Most game features involve working as a team: unlocking [**technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md), capturing **artifacts**, harvesting [**relics**](/Entities/Currencies/index.md), and fighting in the [**Alliance War**](Alliances.md).

!!! tip "Join early"
    There is **no downside** to joining a corporation and many benefits. New players should find a friendly, active corp as soon as possible. Corps can provide hunting groups, access to better [**ships**](/Ships/index.md), protection from [**PvP**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/index.md), and more.

## How Corporations Work

### Leveling and skills

Corporations earn **XP from every kill**, then level up and train [**skills**](/Gameplay/Skills.md) just like players. A corporation's skill and technology choices apply to **all ships** owned by its members.

### Starting structures

Every corporation begins with:

* One [**Planet**](/Entities/Structures/Planets.md)
* One [**Garrison**](/Entities/Structures/Garrisons.md)
* One [**Outpost**](/Entities/Structures/Outposts.md)
* One [**Shipyard**](/Entities/Structures/Shipyards.md)

These [**defense units**](/Entities/Structures/index.md) are leveled up using **resource deposits**, which unlock more [**Equip Points**](/Ships/Equip-Points.md) and gear slots. Defense units may be deployed in PvP [**system maps**](/World/Maps/index.md) to grow corporation and [**alliance**](Alliances.md) territory.

### Unlocking more structures

Corporation members can invest [**Tech Points**](/Entities/Currencies/Tech%20Points.md) to unlock **additional** defense units from the **Corporation Management** panel. See the [Structures overview](/Entities/Structures/index.md) for limits (e.g. up to 4 Garrisons, 8 Outposts, 3 Shipyards).

### Corporate Defenders

Ships owned by corp members can be summoned as [**Corporate Defenders**](Corporate-Defenders.md) to protect defense units under attack. They deploy automatically and fight under the game's AI — and recall if the owner logs in.
