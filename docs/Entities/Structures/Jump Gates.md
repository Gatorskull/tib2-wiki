# Jump Gates

**Jump Gates** are static, neutral structures that **connect solar systems**. You use them to move between [maps](/World/Maps/index.md) — you cannot cross a map edge without a Jump Gate.

## Ownership and Behavior

* **Ownership:** Jump Gates are **not owned** by any player or NPC.
* **Permanent:** They exist as fixed points linking specific systems.
* **Combat:** Jump Gates cannot be attacked or destroyed.

## Safety (PvP)

In [PvP maps](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/index.md), you are **relatively safe at Jump Gates** between systems — **but only if you are not flagged in combat**. If you are in combat, you can still be attacked at the gate.

!!! danger "Never 100% safe in PvP"
    In PvP space you are never fully safe; gates only provide relative safety when not in combat.

## Quick Jump

From the **hamburger menu** you can [**Quick Jump**](/World/Maps/index.md#quick-jump) to any **discovered human-faction Jump Gate** (or to alliance [defense units](/Entities/Structures/index.md)). Cost: **1 [Tech Point](/Entities/Currencies/Tech%20Points.md)** per jump. Human [Garrisons](/Entities/Structures/Garrisons.md) are located at Jump Gates in PvE maps and can be Quick Jump targets once discovered.
