# Artifacts

**Artifacts** are mysterious alien objects scattered across the universe in *The Infinite Black 2*. There are **over 50** of them. Corporations capture and store them at [**planets**](Planets.md) and [**garrisons**](Garrisons.md) to gain [**technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md) benefits. Any player can **study** an artifact to permanently gain **+1 [Skill Point](/Gameplay/Skills.md)**.

## Corporation Control and Tech Bonus

When a [**corporation**](/Entities/Corporations/index.md) controls an artifact (by having it stored at one of their planets or garrisons):

- **All members** of that corporation receive the artifact’s **technology bonus**.
- This applies **regardless** of the member’s Skill Tree investment or unlocked tech research — the bonus is global for the corp while they hold the artifact.
- If the corporation **loses control** of the artifact (e.g. it is captured or the structure is destroyed), the tech bonus is **lost** for that corp. The bonus is only active while they control it.

So capturing and holding artifacts is a major goal for corps that want to boost their entire membership.

## Studying Artifacts (Skill Points)

Any player can **STUDY** an artifact. Studying is a **one-time, permanent** action:

- Studying an artifact **permanently** awards **+1 [Skill Point](/Gameplay/Skills.md)** to that captain.
- This is a long-term goal: many players seek out artifacts over the course of the game to collect every possible bonus skill point.

### Who Can Study?

- **Uncaptured artifacts** — Any player can study them.
- **Corporation-captured artifacts** — Only **alliance members** of the corporation that holds the artifact can study it. This is both a perk for joining that corp/alliance and an incentive for outsiders to attack and **liberate** artifacts so they can study them too.

Once a player has studied an artifact, the **+1 Skill Point is kept forever** — even if the corp later loses the artifact. Only the **corp tech bonus** is tied to control; the personal skill bonus is permanent.
