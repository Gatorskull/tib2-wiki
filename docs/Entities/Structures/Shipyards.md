**Shipyards** [**construct**](../../Ships/Ship-Crafting.md) new [**ships**](../../Ships/index.md) for corporation members and unlock new blueprints as they level up. Each corporation can have up to **3 Shipyards**.

## Capacity & Factions

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Limit** | Up to **3** Shipyards per corporation. |
| **Faction** | Each Shipyard is dedicated to **one faction** (Pirate, Het, Wyrd, Precursor). Corp leadership chooses the faction; that Shipyard then builds that faction’s ships. |
