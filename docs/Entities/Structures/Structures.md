# Structures Overview

Structures form the backbone of territory control and economy in *The Infinite Black 2*.

## NPC Factions & Behavior

The universe is populated by five major factions: **Humans, Wyrd, Hets, Precursors, and Pirates**. Their structures behave differently depending on their alignment.

### Human (Friendly)
* **Behavior:** Non-hostile. They allow players to deposit items.
* **Roaming:** Human Outposts and Shipyards randomly roam the maps.
* **Quick Jump:**
    * **Garrisons:** :white_check_mark: Allowed (if discovered).
    * **Outposts/Shipyards:** :x: Cannot Quick Jump to these.

### Enemies (Wyrd, Hets, Precursors, Pirates)
* **Behavior:** Hostile.
* **Spawning:** Structures randomly spawn (and respawn) in **PvP Maps** and **Security 9 PvE Maps** controlled by that faction.

## Deployment
All Corporation structures follow strict rules for placement and movement.
