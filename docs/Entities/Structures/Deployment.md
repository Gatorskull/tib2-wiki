# Structure Deployment

Deploying Corporation structures is a strategic action that allows you to claim territory and set up forward operating bases.

## Deployment Costs & Mechanics

* **Cost:** **15 Tech Points** per deployment.
* **Duration:** Structures are permanent until recalled or destroyed (see *PvE Exceptions* below).
* **Movement:** Structures are static once deployed. To move them, they must be recalled and re-deployed.

## Recall Process

Recalling a structure returns it to the Corporation inventory. Recalls are immediately stopped if a structure is combat flagged in an engagement. 

* **Timer:** Recalling takes exactly **3 minutes**.
    * *Note: This timer may fluctuate slightly (by a few seconds) depending on server health/tick rate.*

## Restrictions & Blocking

You cannot deploy a structure just anywhere. The following conditions must be met:

### 1. Sector Exclusivity
Only **one structure of each type** can exist per sector.
*(e.g., You cannot place a Garrison in a sector that already has a Garrison).*

### 2. Proximity Blocking
Deployment is blocked if **Enemy Entities** are present in the current sector or any connected sector (1-sector radius).

* **Blocking Entities:** Enemy Structures (Player or NPC) and Enemy Player Ships.
* **Non-Blocking Entities:** NPC Ships.

### 3. Combat Flag
You cannot deploy structures while your active ship has a **Combat Flag**.
* *Workaround:* You may select a different, unflagged ship to initiate the deployment.

## PvE Map Specifics

In PvE maps, to prevent clutter and stagnation, specific limits apply:

* **Map Capacity:** There is a limit of **7 Player-Owned Structures** per map.
* **Auto-Recall:** Structures in PvE maps will automatically recall after **15 Days**.
