# Garrisons

**Garrisons** are powerful defensive structures. Each corporation can have up to **4 Garrisons**. They provide a **Garrison Strike** area attack and are the **only** structure that can capture [**Relic Shrines**](../Currencies/Relics.md).

## Combat & Stats

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Garrison Strike** | Area attack similar to **Nova** explosions. Damage is based on the Garrison’s **level** and **Max [Equip Points](../../Ships/Equip-Points.md)**. |
| **Hull/Shield** | **+Max Hull** and **+Max Shield** stats are multiplied by **×30**. |
| **Relic Shrines** | [Relic Shrines](../Currencies/Relics.md) can **only** be captured by placing a Garrison on them. Corps deploy Garrisons on shrines to harvest Relics for their [alliance](../Corporations/Alliances.md). |

## Human Garrisons (PvE)

In PvE maps, the Human faction has Garrisons to aid travel:

* **Location:** Always at **[Jump Gates](Jump Gates.md)**.
* **Quick Jump:** You can **Quick Jump** to these Garrisons if you’ve discovered them.

## Elite Ranks

Higher-tier Garrisons need [**Skulls**](../Currencies/Skulls.md) for Elite versions and offer much better durability and firepower. Defense unit Elite Rank costs are **5×** ship costs (see [Skulls](../Currencies/Skulls.md)).

## Deployment

* **Owner:** Corporation (player or NPC).
* **Cost:** 15 [Tech Points](../Currencies/Tech Points.md).
* **Rules:** See [Deployment](Deployment.md).
