# Structures Overview

Structures (defense units) form the backbone of territory control and economy in *The Infinite Black 2*. Any [**corporation**](../Corporations/index.md) that wants to survive must upgrade and maintain them — they build ships, protect **artifacts**, and spread a sphere of influence that helps members and hurts intruders.

Captains earn bonus [**Skulls**](../Currencies/Skulls.md) for **both defending and attacking** non-NPC structures. Participation in structure warfare is one of the best ways to earn Skulls.

!!! danger "Gear Score requirement"
    **Defense units must have 3,000+ [Gear Score](../../Items/index.md) or be recalled!** Equip them properly or they will be forced back.

## Corporation Limits

Every corporation starts with one of each type and can unlock more with [**Tech Points**](../Currencies/Tech Points.md) (Corporation Management panel).

| Structure   | Start | Max | Notes |
|-------------|:-----:|:---:|-------|
| **Planets** | 1     | 1   | Central hub; system-wide tech bonus; respawn option. |
| **Garrisons** | 1   | 4   | Garrison Strike; only structure that can capture [Relic Shrines](../Currencies/Relics.md). |
| **Outposts** | 1    | 8   | Territory growth; movement/resist bonus for corp in range. |
| **Shipyards** | 1   | 3   | Build [ships](../../Ships/index.md) for corp members; one faction per shipyard. |

## How Defense Units Fight

* **Firepower** — Designed as **10–15 ships’ worth**. Most stats are **×10** in attack calculations — one good item on a defense is like one good item on ~15 ships.
* **Weapons & drones** — Attack **faster** than their listed speed. **Slower weapons get a bigger bonus**; equipping very slow weapons is highly advantageous.
* **Targeting** — Defenses **ignore** [ship size](../../Ships/index.md) targeting limits and target nearly instantly.
* **Stat multipliers** — All defense units: **+Splash Chance ×10**, **Battery Capacity ×10**, **Battery Recharge ×4**. No 10% auxiliary item penalty like ships. Weapons and fighter drones attack **×6** faster than normal.
* **Leveling** — Level up defense units with **resources** from their inspect menu.

---

## Defense Shields (PvP)

When any defense unit is **attacked**:

* **90-second immunity** — The structure (and all ships in the sector) get a 90-second shield so defenders can organize. All ships in sector are immune to PvP during this period, including attackers.
* **1-hour shield** — After enough **attackers** die, a 1-hour protection shield is raised to give defenders a break.
* **:ALLIANCE SHIELD** — Alliance leaders can type this in chat to raise a **4-hour shield** **once per day**.

---

## Quick Jump & Tactics

* **Quick Jump** — You can Quick Jump to **any structure under attack** **except Outposts**. Cost: 1 [Tech Point](../Currencies/Tech Points.md) per jump.
* **Blocking Quick Jump** — **Engage** an enemy defense unit to prevent defenders from Quick Jumping to it.

---

## Loot & Drops

* **NPC defenses** — Drop high-quality items and rare crafting components.
* **All defenses** — Drop hundreds or thousands of resources when destroyed.
* **Non-NPC defenses** — Players earn [**Skulls**](../Currencies/Skulls.md) for killing them.

## PvE Deployment

Defenses can be deployed in **human-controlled PvE maps** but **recall automatically after 15 days**. See [Deployment](Deployment.md) for full rules.
