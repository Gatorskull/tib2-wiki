# Entities

**Entities** are the organizations, currencies, and structures that shape the world of *The Infinite Black 2*: **corporations** and their **alliances**, the **currencies** and **resources** you earn and spend, and the **structures** (planets, garrisons, outposts, shipyards) that corps deploy for territory and rewards.

## How they connect

- **Corporations** hold **structures** and spend [**Tech Points**](Currencies/Tech Points.md) to unlock more. They use [**Skulls**](Currencies/Skulls.md) and [**Relics**](Currencies/Relics.md) to build [ships](../Ships/index.md) at [**Shipyards**](Structures/Shipyards.md).
- **Structures** store [**Artifacts**](Structures/Artifacts.md) (corp tech bonus; study for +1 Skill Point) and capture [**Relic Shrines**](Currencies/Relics.md) via Garrisons.
- **Currencies** fund everything: corps, upgrades, Quick Jump, and the in-game economy.
