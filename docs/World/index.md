# The World

The universe of *The Infinite Black 2* is not a single infinite void, but a collection of distinct **Solar Systems** (Maps) connected by a network of **[Jump Gates](Jump_Gates.md)**.

## The Map Grid
Every Solar System is a **14x14 Grid** of Sectors.
* **Coordinates:** Ranges from `(0,0)` in the bottom-left to `(14,14)` in the top-right.
* **Traversal:** Crossing the edge of a map does *not* loop you around; you must use a [Jump Gate](Jump_Gates.md) to leave the system.

## Navigation
To travel the universe, a Captain must move their fleet through individual **[Sectors](Sectors.md)**.
* **Movement:** Click an adjacent sector to engage engines.
* **Speed:** Movement speed is determined by your slowest ship (or largest hull).
* **Safety:** Some systems are patrolled by the **Earth Defense Force** (Safe), while others are lawless warzones (PvP). See **[Map Security Ratings](Maps.md)** for details.
