**Security Rating (SR)** defines how dangerous a sector of space is in _The Infinite Black 2_. It directly affects the **strength of enemy ships**, the **risk of travel**, and the **level of preparation required** to survive.

Security Ratings range from **SR1** (safest) to **SR9** (most dangerous).

## Overview

As you move farther from protected space, security decreases and threats escalate. Higher Security Ratings feature:

- Stronger and more aggressive enemy ships
    
- Higher-level equipment and builds on NPCs
    
- Increased likelihood of rapid ship destruction if unprepared
    

!!! warning "Progression Warning"  
Entering a higher Security Rating than your ship can handle will almost always result in destruction.

## Practical Effects of Security Rating

Security Rating influences more than just enemy strength:

- **Travel Risk:** Higher SR sectors leave little time to react to ambushes
    
- **Ship Loss:** Destruction is common in high SR without proper defenses
    
- **Preparation Requirements:** Shield tier, weapon optimization, and build synergy become mandatory

## Tips for Pilots

- Progress gradually through Security Ratings rather than skipping ahead
    
- Treat each SR increase as a gear and build check
    
- If enemies feel overwhelming, retreat and improve your ship before advancing
    

!!! tip "Survival Rule"  
If you can’t comfortably win multiple fights in a sector, you’re not ready for its Security Rating.
