# Maps

The universe is made of **solar systems** (maps). Each map is a **15×15 grid** of [sectors](Sectors.md). There are **over 50 solar systems** to explore, with different security levels, factions, and rewards.

## Viewing the Starmap

**Hamburger menu** (near your player button) → **Starmap**.

From the Starmap you can see systems, [**Security Ratings**](Security Rating.md), and plan travel. Use [**Jump Gates**](../../Entities/Structures/Jump Gates.md) to move between systems.

## PvE vs PvP

| Map type | Safety | Shown on Starmap |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Human-controlled (PvE)** | **Safe** — no player attacks | Typically **blue** |
| **Other factions (PvP)** | [**PvP possible**](../../Gameplay/Activities/Player vs Player (PVP)/index.md) | Different coloring |

You are always safe in **human-controlled space**. Beyond that, [**Corporations**](../../Entities/Corporations/index.md) and [**Alliances**](../../Entities/Corporations/Alliances.md) battle for territory and [**Relics**](../../Entities/Currencies/Relics.md). Each of the five factions (Humans, Wyrd, Hets, Precursors, Pirates) controls systems and has a powerful **homeworld** that advanced corps can raid for high-value rewards.

## Quick Jump

From the **hamburger menu** you can **Quick Jump** to:

* Any [**defense unit**](../../Entities/Structures/index.md) in your alliance
* Any **human-faction jump gate** you’ve discovered

Cost: **1 [Tech Point](../../Entities/Currencies/Tech Points.md)** per jump (no matter how many ships move).
