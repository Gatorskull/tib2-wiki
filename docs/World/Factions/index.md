# Factions

The [Starmap](/World/Maps/index.md) is controlled by **five factions**. Each has its own ship variants, homeworld, and lore. Human-controlled space is safe; the other four factions control systems where [PvP](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/index.md) is possible and where [corporations](/Entities/Corporations/index.md) fight for territory and [Relics](/Entities/Currencies/Relics.md).
