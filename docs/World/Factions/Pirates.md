# The Pirate Faction

**Pirates** are humans who originated on **Earth in the Sol system**. Severe over-pollution and resource exploitation forced many to flee; corporations saved their loyalists and abandoned the rest, leading to the death of billions. **Pirate Fleets** formed from survivors in ragtag, improvised ships.

## Earth and the EDF

The **Earth Defense Force** is a fascist, nationalistic human faction that remains on the planet, guarding what little is left. Their main export is a constant flow of desperate colonists, the elderly, and prisoners. They often give earthlings a small ship in exchange for **permanent indentured servitude**.

## Humans in Space

* **Adaptation** — Humans on other planets and stations have adapted to their environments, with visible physical and genetic differences among colonial populations. All are carbon-based, breathe oxygen, and have a nine-month gestation period; traits like hair, height, and weight vary widely.
* **Clones** — Corporations have augmented their forces with **vat-grown clones** engineered for war (no pain or fear). It is estimated that **over 70%** of all living humans in the universe are warrior clones, fighting aliens and each other.

## Corporate vs Pirate Humans

* **Corporate** — Driven by greed; corporate espionage and deceit are common. There is no shared code of honor; profits go to leadership.
* **Pirate** — Also pursue wealth but often abandon social bonds and follow **laws or a code of honor**. Codes vary by clan and are important for negotiation and trade.

Humans have been in open war with every known alien species for hundreds of years. Most believe the only alternative is extinction and that survival is what matters.
