# The Het

The **Hets** are a mysterious species that live in **open space** and move in **large herds or pods** (similar to Earth's cetaceans), with an average pod size of about fifty. Individual encounters are extremely rare. Their social structure is almost nonexistent — they seem to operate on a **hive-mind**, with a single unit acting only for the pod's well-being, with no regard for individuality.

## History

* **Once docile** — Hets used to become aggressive only when threatened, preferring to flee or resorting to organized swarm attacks if necessary. They were mainly a navigation hazard, attacking ships only when their young were endangered.
* **Wyrd virus** — The [**Wyrd**](Wyrd.md) introduced a **techno-organic virus** to weaponize the Hets against humans. The Hets developed **organo-metallic armor** and **bio-organic weapons**.
* **Loss of control** — Contrary to Wyrd expectations, the Hets resisted control and became a major threat to both Wyrd and humans. Human technology has since adapted to **harvest and integrate Het organs** into their ships.

## Biology and Behavior

* **Form:** Hets resemble **organic long ships** with flukes and tails; they are believed to travel using solar wind currents.
* **Personality:** They show no signs of distinct personalities, likely due to hive-mind dominance.
