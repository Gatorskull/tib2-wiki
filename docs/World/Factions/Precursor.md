# The Precursors

The **Precursors** are a profoundly **ancient** alien race, present in the universe for **billions of years**. They are known for their **ostensibly robotic forms** — it is unclear whether these are their real bodies or avatars. Their advanced technology includes **self-destruct mechanisms** that prevent capture and study, so they remain enigmatic.

## Conflict and Role

* **The Oblivion** — The Precursors are engaged in an obscure conflict with a formidable entity known as **The Oblivion**. The exact nature of this struggle and its implications are not well understood.
* **Communication** — They communicate with other species, including humans, in a way that is **urgent and often cryptic**, suggesting they see themselves as **guardians** against greater cosmic threats. The extent and motivation of this protective stance are as mysterious as their origins.

## What Remains Unknown

Little is known about their societal structures, culture, or ultimate goals. Their interactions with other species combine warning and oblique guidance, adding to their complex role in the setting.
