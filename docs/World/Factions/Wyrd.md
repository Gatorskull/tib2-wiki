# The Wyrd

The **Wyrd** are an alien species that bear a resemblance to Earth's spiders: **eight limbs** — six as legs, two with hands and multiple fingers, allowing intricate tasks with greater precision than humans. Little is known about their social structure; most knowledge comes from injured specimens.

## Biology and Behavior

* **Size:** Captured specimens are comparable in size and weight to Earth's horses.
* **Features:** Eight eyes, large **venomous mandibles** adapted for grinding prey.
* **Venom:** A potent **neurotoxin** that paralyzes prey while keeping it alive for feeding or storage; they may use captured prey as live hosts for their eggs.
* **Communication:** Wyrd can mimic human speech; their native communication involves complex clicks and screeches. Scientists suggest a possible **telepathic** component — efforts to understand their language have failed.

## Society

All observed Wyrd have been **male**, leading to speculation that captured individuals are a worker or warrior caste. Other members of the species may be more dangerous, with greater size, strength, or intelligence. There is no insight into individual Wyrd personalities.

## Role in the Universe

The Wyrd introduced a **techno-organic virus** to the [**Het**](Het.md) in an attempt to weaponize them against humans. The Hets instead became an aggressive threat to both Wyrd and humans; humans later adapted technology to harvest and integrate Het organs into their ships.
