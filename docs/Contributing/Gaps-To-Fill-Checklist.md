# Gaps to Fill — Information to Collect

Use this as a checklist. For each gap, collect the information listed; once you have it, we can update the wiki.

---

## 1. Security Rating (World/Maps/Security Rating.md)

**What we need:** Replace the placeholder numbers for each SR (1–9) with real in-game data.

For **each** Security Rating (SR1 through SR9), please collect:

| Field | Example (current placeholder) | Your data |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| NPC ship level range | e.g. SR1: 1–10 | |
| Max NPC ships per sector | e.g. SR1: 3 | |
| Recommended player level range | e.g. 1–10 | |
| Recommended ship hull tier | e.g. T1–T2 | |
| Any special notes | e.g. “Starter-friendly” | |

**Where to get it:** In-game observation, dev/patch notes, or community notes. If exact numbers aren’t available, “best guess” ranges are fine — we’ll mark them as indicative.

---

## 2. Equip Points (Ships/Equip-Points.md)

**What we need:** Either (a) remove the “Full details coming soon” box, or (b) add real content so the box can be removed.

Please collect (if available):

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **EP by ship class** | How many Equip Points each ship class (or size) has (e.g. Shuttle 10, Frigate 15, …). |
| **EP by ship tier/level** | Does EP change with ship level or tier? |
| **Defense unit EP** | How EP works for Planets, Garrisons, Outposts, Shipyards (base and per level if applicable). |
| **Item cost rules** | How item rank/rarity affects EP cost (e.g. “each rank adds X”). |

**Where to get it:** In-game ship/unit inspect, in-game wiki, or HELP. If you can’t get full tables, a few examples (e.g. “Shuttle has X EP”, “Rank 5 weapon costs Y EP”) are enough to expand the page.

---

## 3. Technology (Gameplay/Technology.md)

**What we need:** Enough to replace “We'll add a categorized overview here” with real content.

Please collect (any that you can):

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **Categories** | How techs are grouped in-game (e.g. Hull, Weapons, Movement, Crafting). |
| **List or export** | Full technology list from HELP → INFORMATION → TECHNOLOGY LIST, or a screenshot/export. |
| **Ranked vs non-ranked** | Which techs are “ranked” (don’t stack with lower ranks) vs “non-ranked” (stack). Examples are enough. |
| **Sources** | Which techs come from Artifacts vs corp research vs items vs ships (brief list or examples). |

**Where to get it:** In-game HELP → Technology list; in-game wiki; or a text/CSV export if the game allows.

---

## 4. Skills (Gameplay/Skills.md)

**What we need:** Enough to replace “Full skill list and recommendations will be added here” with real content.

Please collect (any that you can):

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **Skill list** | All (or main) captain/ship/corp skills and what they do (e.g. +XP%, Evasion, Hull). |
| **Max points per stat** | e.g. “Up to 10 points per stat, reduced benefit above 5.” |
| **New-player recommendations** | 3–5 “get these first” skills (e.g. +XP%, Evasion) and why. |
| **Where points come from** | Leveling, Artifacts, etc. (we already mention Artifacts; confirm or add). |

**Where to get it:** In-game skill tree, in-game wiki, or community guides.

---

## 5. Weapons (Items/Weapons.md) — optional

**What we need:** Only if you want to go beyond the current overview.

Please collect (optional):

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **Damage types** | e.g. Kinetic, Energy, etc., if the game shows them. |
| **Weapon tiers/ranks** | How weapon rank affects damage or EP cost. |
| **Examples** | A few weapon names and stats (e.g. “Plasma Cannon: Rank 3, 12 EP”). |

**Where to get it:** In-game weapon stats, item inspect, or wiki.

---

## 6. Starmap (optional new page)

**What we need:** Only if you want a dedicated **Starmap** page (we already have World index + Maps).

Please collect (optional):

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **System list** | Names of solar systems (or “50+ systems” and a few examples). |
| **How to open Starmap** | e.g. “Hamburger menu → Starmap”. |
| **What the map shows** | Faction colors, security, jump gates, etc. (we have some of this in Maps; any extra). |

**Where to get it:** In-game Starmap UI and in-game wiki.

---

## 7. Player Guides (Getting Started/Player-Guides.md) — optional

**What we need:** Only if you want to remove the “Guides in progress” box and lock the list.

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **Final list** | Which community guides to keep (with titles + URLs). |
| **Short description** | One line per guide (e.g. “New player basics”, “Gear and builds”). |

## Priority order (suggested)

1. **Security Rating** — One table per SR; high impact for players.
2. **Equip Points** — A few numbers or examples so we can drop “coming soon.”
3. **Technology** — Categories + list (or export) so we can add an overview.
4. **Skills** — List + new-player tips so we can add content.
5. **Weapons / Starmap / Player guides** — Optional; collect if you have time.

When you have the data, you can paste it here (or in a comment) and we can turn it into wiki text and update the pages.
