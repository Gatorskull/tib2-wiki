## 🔶 Expand / deepen — Completed or deferred

| Page | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Ships: Ship Mods** | ✅ **Done** — Full list of 8 mods with effects and sources (Arena, invasions, crafting, etc.). |
| **Items: Diminishing Returns** | ✅ **Done** — Resist and Chance tables added from in-game wiki. |
| **World: Security Rating** | Placeholder structure kept; replace with real NPC level / ship-per-sector data when available. |
| **Gameplay: Activities index** | Already has links to PvP and PvE; expand intro if desired. |

---

## 🔶 Polish (Phase 6 / consistency)

- **Index coverage** — Ensure every section index lists and links all its child pages (most already do).
- **Cross-links** — When a page mentions another concept, link to the canonical page (relative in section, absolute across sections).
- **“See also”** — Most pages have this; add where missing.
- **Broken links** — Search for `](...)` that point to non-existent files; fix or add stubs.
- **Wiki-Fill-Out-Plan** — Optionally add a “Done” subsection and move completed steps there for tracking.

---

## Next steps (optional)

- **Security Rating** — Replace placeholder level/ship-per-sector numbers with official data when available.
- **Weapons** — Add damage types or tier tables if/when detailed data exists.
- **Consistency pass** — Indexes, cross-links, “See also” where still missing.
