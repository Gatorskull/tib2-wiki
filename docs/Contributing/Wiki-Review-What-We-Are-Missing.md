# Wiki Review — What We're Missing

A concise audit of gaps, stubs, and optional additions. Use with [Wiki Status](Wiki-Status.md) and the [Fill-Out Plan](Wiki-Fill-Out-Plan.md).

---

## 1. Stubs / “Coming soon” (need expansion or copy tweaks)

| Page | Current state | Suggested action |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| **Ships: Equip Points** | “Full details coming soon” info box | Expand with EP by ship size, item cost, or remove the box and add a short “see Ships index” line. |
| **Gameplay: Technology** | “We'll add a categorized overview here” | Add a short categorized list or “HELP → Technology” note; or leave as-is until you have the full list. |
| **Gameplay: Skills** | “Full skill list and recommendations will be added here” | Add a short list of key skills (e.g. +XP%, Evasion) or leave until you have full data. |
| **Getting Started: Player Guides** | “Guides in progress” | Keep if you’re still curating; otherwise remove the info box once the list is stable. |

---

## 2. Outdated “page coming soon” in other files

These pages **exist** but are still referred to as “coming soon” or “in progress” elsewhere:

- **FAQ** — Remove “(Page coming soon.)” from the [Equip Points](Getting-Started/FAQ.md) answer; remove “(Items section in progress.)” from the drones answer; remove “(Page coming soon.)” from the [Diminishing Returns](Getting-Started/FAQ.md) answer. The links already point to real pages.

---

## 3. Placeholder data (replace when you have real data)

| Page | What’s placeholder | Action |
|------|--------------------|--------|
| **World: Security Rating** | NPC ship levels, ships per sector, recommended level/hull per SR | Replace with official numbers when available; note in the page that ranges are indicative. |

No other major placeholder blocks found.

---

## 4. Optional / “nice to have” content

| Topic | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **The Starmap** | Only covered in World index + Maps | Plan suggested a dedicated `World/Starmap.md`; optional if Maps + World index are enough. |
| **Weapons: damage types / tiers** | Weapons page is an overview only | Add damage types or tier tables when you have in-game or dev data. |
| **Technology: full list** | Tech page points to HELP menu | Add a categorized overview when you can export or maintain the list. |
| **Skills: full list + recommendations** | Skills page points to FAQ | Add a skill list and/or build tips when you have a stable list. |
| **Entities index** | ✅ Added | New [Entities/index.md](../Entities/index.md) — consider linking it from the homepage Quick Links as “Entities” or “Corporations & more”. |

---

## 5. Structural / navigation

- **Homepage** — Quick Links currently point to Corporations and Currencies but not the new **Entities** index. You could add “Entities” (linking to `Entities/index.md`) so the section is discoverable.
- **Contributing** — Section is hidden from nav; no change needed unless you want it visible again.
- **Index coverage** — Entities, Ships, Items, Gameplay, World, Getting Started all have index pages that list their main children.

---

## 6. Summary

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Quick wins** | Remove the three “(Page coming soon.)” / “(Items section in progress.)” lines from the FAQ. Optionally soften or remove the “Full details coming soon” box on Equip Points. |
| **When you have data** | Replace Security Rating placeholders; add Technology and Skills lists if you want them. |
| **Optional** | Add “Entities” to the homepage Quick Links; add a Starmap page; expand Weapons with damage/tier data. |
