Check out [**How To Play**](How-To-Play.md).

### This game is hard — How do I get better?

Combat is balanced around **multiple ships**. Playing with a team and deploying additional ships is critical to success!

1. Explore **100% of the Sol Star System** to earn your first ship.
2. Click **"Deploy 2nd Ship"** to grow your fleet.
3. Join a [**Corporation**](/Entities/Corporations/index.md) — they provide [**Technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md), [**Skills**](/Gameplay/Skills.md), and group protection.

### What are Equip Points and how do I get more?

**Equip Points** represent how much space your ship has for mounting weapons, armor, storage, etc. **Larger ships** have more Equip Point capacity.

See [**Equip Points**](/Ships/Equip-Points.md) for details. (Page coming soon.)

---

### What chat commands can I use?

Several key features use chat commands (e.g. item auction history, corporation transaction logs). Type **:HELP** into chat for the full list.

---

### What are drones?

Drones are a type of equipment. See the [**Items**](/Items/index.md) section for details on Fighter, Harvester, and Repair drones. (Items section in progress.)

---

### What skills should I get first?

* **New players:** +XP% Bonus helps you level quickly. **Evasion** is the best stat for survivability.
* Talk to your corporation for their recommendations.
* Remember: **Corporation, Captain, and Ship** [**Skills**](/Gameplay/Skills.md) all stack!

---

### How do I get more Ship XP, Player XP, or Corp XP?

[**Technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md), [**Skills**](/Gameplay/Skills.md), and [**Items**](/Items/index.md) all stack to give your ships a **+XP% Bonus**. When you kill an NPC you gain XP based on your ship's level vs the target's level. A share of that goes to your player, and a share to your corporation — so boosting ship XP boosts all three.

---

### What is Ship Durability?

When ships are destroyed they can lose a small amount of **durability**. This reduces certain [**stats**](/Items/Stats.md) (Resource Capacity, Hull, Shields, Resists). Repair ship durability with [**Skulls**](/Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md) using the **REPAIR** button on the ship inspection panel.

---

### How do I get Skulls?

Skulls are earned only from [**Player vs Player Combat**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/index.md). See the [**Skulls**](/Entities/Currencies/Skulls.md) article for details and [**The Arena**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/Arena.md) as the main way to earn them.

---

### What is Item Durability?

[**Equipment**](/Items/index.md) can take damage when your ship dies. This doesn't change the item's stat bonuses, but an item at **0% Durability** cannot be equipped until repaired. Repair via the item → **Upgrade** → **Repair**.

---

### What ship should I build first?

* **Scrapping** junk uncommon and basic gear for resources is the fastest way to build up for another ship.
* **Het and Precursor faction Cruisers** are solid choices to get started in [**The Arena**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/Arena.md) and [**PvP**](/Gameplay/Activities/Player%20vs%20Player%20(PVP)/index.md). You'll need to join a corporation with the correct faction shipyard.

---

### Why do my ship stats seem lower than they should be?

See [**Stat Bonus Diminishing Returns**](/Items/Diminishing-Returns.md). Stats use diminishing returns so stacking one stat gives less benefit the more you have. (Page coming soon.)

---

### How can I support this game?

The best way is to [**Review The Game**](Review-The-Game.md) on your platform's store. It helps the indie developers a lot!
