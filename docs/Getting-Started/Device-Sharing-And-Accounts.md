# Device Sharing and Multiple Accounts

**One [Spellbook](Spellbook.md) account per player.** You cannot have two or more accounts under any circumstances, even if you use multiple devices.

## Enforcement

Breaking this rule results in **ALL accounts permanently banned** — including accounts used by roommates, family members, or others on the same device or network.

The "One Account" rule keeps the game fair. Multiple accounts ruined the original *Infinite Black*; the same policy applies here.

## If You Believe It's a Mistake

Email **Contact@Spellbook.com** for help. Be aware: they will ask for proof.

!!! note "Data we use"
    Spellbook does not collect personal information. They only see data similar to a website: e.g. IP address, game client, and similar technical data.
