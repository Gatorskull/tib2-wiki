# How To Play

Getting started in The Infinite Black 2 is easy!

You are the **captain of a small spaceship** exploring the universe: killing pirates, gathering resources, and looting treasure.

## The Universe = Sectors

The universe is represented by a **map of connected squares, called sectors**.

Think of a sector like a **room**: inside you will find enemies to kill, asteroids to harvest, and other players. Travel from sector to sector by **clicking on the squares** to plot a course.

## Your First Goals

* Your first [**Mission**](/Gameplay/Missions.md) is to **explore the Sol Star System** while fighting pirates and harvesting asteroids.
* You will receive free [**ships**](/Ships/index.md) as you level up and explore. Once you earn another ship, click **"Deploy 2nd Ship"** to grow your fleet!

## Scale and Difficulty

The universe is huge — **over 30,000 sectors** to explore. Enemies become more difficult in higher [**Security Rating**](/World/Maps/Security%20Rating.md) maps, where players fight for territory with their corporation.

## Join a Corporation Early

Joining a [**Corporation**](/Entities/Corporations/index.md) early is very important! Corps provide:

* [**Technology**](/Gameplay/Technology.md) benefits
* Advice and hunting groups
* Access to advanced [**ship construction**](/Ships/Ship-Crafting.md) (shipyards)

If your corporation isn't helpful, find one that is — they benefit from you joining too.
